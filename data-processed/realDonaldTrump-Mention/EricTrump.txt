Mon May 07 01:29:25 +0000 2012 Clearly, @LisaLampanelli pulled the oldest trick in the #CelebrityApprentice handbook, but @Teresa_Giudice &amp; her team survive it?
Sat May 05 02:02:18 +0000 2012 Proud to be in Louisiana tonight supporting #skyhighforstjude at their live auction for @StJude in Lafayette http://t.co/wfH91KHY

Mon Apr 23 02:01:28 +0000 2012 @ArsenioOFFICIAL, that was pretty damn funny.  Gotta love #georgeross for telling it like it is - after all, @realDonaldTrump always has..
Mon Apr 23 01:57:10 +0000 2012 So what did you guys think of @LisaLampanelli scoping out the competition?  Was it simple fun or is it no holds barred at this point...
Mon Apr 23 01:53:33 +0000 2012 Thx Melanie.  @Dayanamendoza is a tough act to follow...“@Melrose70: @EricTrump so GQ tonight!”
