Sun Aug 14 02:12:51 +0000 2016 @mattzollerseitz I'm sure he won't still be single at 50
Sun Aug 14 01:47:11 +0000 2016 @edenjw @AJDelgado13 of course not, and I said disagreement is totally cool just be respectful to MOH recipient.
Sun Aug 14 01:46:11 +0000 2016 @theonerealstorm @StevenKusek1 @AJDelgado13 I don't think accusing @Dakota_Meyer of being hysterical is accurate or respectful
Sat Aug 13 22:05:01 +0000 2016 @lpn678 not for the first two https://t.co/JJRIIaIhO9
Sat Aug 13 22:03:20 +0000 2016 @StevenKusek1 @theonerealstorm @AJDelgado13 @Dakota_Meyer my point exactly
Sat Aug 13 22:03:08 +0000 2016 @ReligionFreeMns @AJDelgado13 @Rebel_Bill someone has, thats for sure.
Sat Aug 13 22:00:21 +0000 2016 @ReligionFreeMns @AJDelgado13 @Rebel_Bill Saying that a Medal of Honor recipient deserves basic respect offends you how?
Sat Aug 13 21:59:16 +0000 2016 @RaptorsUniverse @edenjw not in elections i cover, no. but for mayor, city council, yes.
Sat Aug 13 21:55:16 +0000 2016 @Born2Rezist i'm explaining his thinking, not rationalizing it

Sat Aug 13 21:13:23 +0000 2016 @RobProvince thanks. i can't read her tweets but I'm told she's now accusing me of sexism?? sigh
Sat Aug 13 21:12:45 +0000 2016 @edenjw You disagree with the notion a Medal of Honor recipient deserves respect? @AJDelgado13 has blocked me so can't see this conversation
Sat Aug 13 20:54:43 +0000 2016 @RobProvince @SLHebner if I were @IBM I wouldn't want one of my executives attacking someone for defending @Dakota_Meyer either
Sat Aug 13 20:39:45 +0000 2016 @dmartosko @alanagoodman very strong hire...
Sat Aug 13 20:19:35 +0000 2016 @ThePurpleCat16 I like @AJDelgado13 just fine, it's just that @Dakota_Meyer deserves respect
Sat Aug 13 20:18:34 +0000 2016 @RobProvince so odd. For saying @Dakota_Meyer deserves respect @AJDelgado13 blocked me and an IBM VP attacked me. What a world.
Sat Aug 13 20:17:33 +0000 2016 @Jaklovsky @jeffbercovici then he has my vote
Sat Aug 13 19:36:56 +0000 2016 @SLHebner my only agenda was saying @Dakota_Meyer should be treated with respect. I'm sorry the VP of Marketing for @IBM objects to that.
Sat Aug 13 19:33:58 +0000 2016 @SLHebner I find it curious that an @IBM VP would start attacking someone for defending @Dakota_Meyer. This is about your agenda not mine.
Sat Aug 13 19:10:14 +0000 2016 @SLHebner this was the conversation you got involved in. I was saying someone should show respect to @Dakota_Meyer. @IBM disagrees?
Sat Aug 13 18:53:07 +0000 2016 @SLHebner is it the position of @IBM that Medal of Honor recipients should be disrespected for standing up for Gold Star families?
Sat Aug 13 18:48:49 +0000 2016 @raidermike5569 @AJDelgado13 @Dakota_Meyer I've reported their story more than Captain Khans.

Sat Aug 13 18:29:26 +0000 2016 @raidermike5569 @AJDelgado13 @Dakota_Meyer i have no candidate and have interviewed Mrs. Smith several times and defended her on air.
Sat Aug 13 18:27:34 +0000 2016 @AJDelgado13 you need to show @Dakota_Meyer some respect. Disagree, fine, but this is a man who has earned better than your twitter snark.
Sat Aug 13 18:19:46 +0000 2016 @AJDelgado13 @Dakota_Meyer this isn't about them being criticized, it's about them being falsely smeared with lies. Quite a difference.

Sat Aug 13 16:31:49 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 that might be true but that also speaks to laxness in safety until accidents
Sat Aug 13 15:04:36 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 @CLEQuality ...bc i wanted to explain the history and also go into lobbying and how DC "works"
Sat Aug 13 15:04:03 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 @CLEQuality and i think even a hint of "silver bullet" is a failure of the piece, however long and detailed it was...
Sat Aug 13 15:03:09 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 @CLEQuality also, i don't know about you, but i do assume (wrongly) that there have been safety inspections of the rides
Sat Aug 13 15:02:46 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 @CLEQuality i agree with that 100%. but also think the former Six Flags exec was compelling about a real problem
Sat Aug 13 15:01:41 +0000 2016 @DMartyr that wasn't a joke, i overheard it and thought it was interesting.
Sat Aug 13 15:01:07 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 @CLEQuality i don't know that I have faith in anyone, but some states take inspections more seriously than others
Sat Aug 13 14:59:33 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 @CLEQuality We saw the result of that Sunday. Watch the piece -- a former Six Flags/IAAPA board member weighed in.
Sat Aug 13 14:56:47 +0000 2016 @AdamBaldwin ha ha - hope you're well and enjoying this glorious day
Sat Aug 13 14:52:05 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 @CLEQuality opening of the ride was delayed several times for safety reasons. Since opening in 2014 Kansas inspect it: 0 times.
Sat Aug 13 14:51:02 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 @CLEQuality was the Verrukt ride safe? Was it sufficient to have the park/insurance company inspect itself? Did Kansas fail?

Sat Aug 13 14:28:44 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 @CLEQuality ...the more info the better to keep these rides as safe as possible.
Sat Aug 13 14:28:11 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 @CLEQuality ...can argue that one central clearinghouse for info to be shared among parks would make things safer since...
Sat Aug 13 14:27:23 +0000 2016 @jadler1969 @CLEQuality that's a fair q but in this instance it's clear the empowered states are not all doing their jobs. One also...

Thu Aug 11 20:48:37 +0000 2016 @JordanChariton I'm on air right now but maybe I misunderstood the hiring you're referring to. @DrewGriffinCNN had 2 examples in his spot...
Thu Aug 11 20:22:47 +0000 2016 @JordanChariton yes again, in the @DrewGriffinCNN report, he got the facts right that you're now bungling. This note was not about a donor.
Thu Aug 11 20:21:44 +0000 2016 @JordanChariton that note wasn't about a donor. It was about a lower level advance staffer getting a job.

Sat Jul 23 18:48:04 +0000 2016 To follow on coverage of #DNCleak tmrw on @CNNSotu - why then? That's the next time I'm on tv. Sunday show coverage is far from "burying"

Sat Jul 23 16:15:43 +0000 2016 @WillMcAvoyACN @ron_fournier @jonfavs which fears? violent crime up in major cities in 2015 is accurate. Though overall rate down
Sat Jul 23 16:14:33 +0000 2016 @jonfavs @davidplouffe no that's not why I think this race is close. But addressing those fears is part of Trump's appeal

Sat Jul 23 16:05:42 +0000 2016 @mikeythetrask @jonfavs the fact that I went to Dartmouth means I have no right to suggest a political remark sounds elitist?
Sat Jul 23 16:04:24 +0000 2016 @neeratanden @jonfavs I get that was the intention but there's a line between mocking him and mocking legit voters fears he's addressing

Sat Jul 23 15:07:34 +0000 2016 @jonfavs my point is there is a line for folks to be cautious of here -mocking Trump versus mocking those willing to hear him out.
Sat Jul 23 15:05:35 +0000 2016 @jonfavs @davidplouffe your asserting that something is beyond obvious is not empirical data. And it highlights why this race is competitive
Sat Jul 23 15:00:57 +0000 2016 @jonfavs there's a line between mocking Trump and mocking the fears of Americans (jobs, crime, terrorism). Latter not a good look.

Mon Jul 18 17:35:24 +0000 2016 @mzkellymac @valsocal @BluthX I am now aware that some people find it offensive and I will try to stop using it.
Mon Jul 18 16:30:46 +0000 2016 @BluthX @mzkellymac I'm fine no longer using it, but it's apparently news to even the president that it's now considered offensive
Mon Jul 18 16:29:07 +0000 2016 @BluthX @mzkellymac Her argument is that a mainstream term widely considered respectful is anachronistic. Citing POTUS using it is relevant

Mon Jul 18 15:22:13 +0000 2016 @mzkellymac @FRANKSKI @ABGray @mixcom @FrankieDarcell I sent a link of President Obama using the term. Is he stuck in the 50s too?

Mon Jul 18 15:10:20 +0000 2016 @FRANKSKI @mzkellymac @ABGray @mixcom @FrankieDarcell I'm not married to the term -- I just never heard before that it's now verboten
Mon Jul 18 15:09:41 +0000 2016 @FRANKSKI @mzkellymac @ABGray @mixcom @FrankieDarcell I believe the context was reference to police relations with communities of color
Mon Jul 18 15:05:09 +0000 2016 @mzkellymac @ABGray @mixcom @FrankieDarcell @FRANKSKI The question is whether "communities of color" is an offensive term.

Wed Jun 15 20:57:30 +0000 2016 @UghSpareMe @Teri423 this is an unimaginable tragedy
Wed Jun 15 20:56:39 +0000 2016 @UghSpareMe @Teri423 people going through horrific ordeals sometimes talk about it, I don't think my coverage was in any way insensitive
Wed Jun 15 20:51:35 +0000 2016 @TequilaJoJo if you think that signage is perfectly acceptable that's your right. It isn't empirical fact.
Wed Jun 15 20:50:51 +0000 2016 @sharonlgraine these are horrific inexcusable acts of violence by whites against blacks -- tragic and awful. But a different category.
Wed Jun 15 20:44:44 +0000 2016 @jat56bah @YousefAlNaimi @fanazer_JTG it's great that the Saudi government knows so much about the terrorists that Saudis help finance
Wed Jun 15 20:42:39 +0000 2016 @TequilaJoJo reporters question things. That's what we do.
Wed Jun 15 20:30:13 +0000 2016 @RedRosete agree
Wed Jun 15 20:29:55 +0000 2016 @Bergen2 I think you misunderstood

Wed Jun 15 19:29:23 +0000 2016 @AtticusinCanada yes I made that analysis but it was later in he conversation and not his major motivation in any way
Wed Jun 15 18:57:29 +0000 2016 @Gord2100 well, we value you so much we actually tell you that personally
Wed Jun 15 18:56:31 +0000 2016 @aa2157 a start: governments allowing basic human rights to their people and no longer funding groups that target innocents for murder
Wed Jun 15 18:55:19 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG @YousefAlNaimi yes I have.
Wed Jun 15 17:47:54 +0000 2016 @YousefAlNaimi @fanazer_JTG I dare you to devote your energies to bringing basic human rights to Saudi Arabia.
Wed Jun 15 17:41:38 +0000 2016 @aa2157 you can change the subject all you want but this isn't a debate or a defense of the war in Iraq
Wed Jun 15 17:32:06 +0000 2016 @MHOsborne how do you know this?
Wed Jun 15 17:29:36 +0000 2016 @BudWyser how did that withdrawal work out? Well?
Wed Jun 15 17:28:41 +0000 2016 .@YousefAlNaimi @fanazer_JTG open your eyes. Saudi Arabia's record on human rights and funding extremism is a travesty

Wed Jun 15 12:15:15 +0000 2016 @willfull19 @seanmdav @jamespmanley also true
Wed Jun 15 03:43:08 +0000 2016 @jamespmanley peace? https://t.co/0bxWQ51lhl
Wed Jun 15 03:42:10 +0000 2016 @jamespmanley I think you're aces! I wasn't trying to pick a fight, I thought you'd chortle at the memory
Wed Jun 15 03:40:56 +0000 2016 @jamespmanley here's the exchange. He didn't answer the question, hope you're well! https://t.co/ljZCLz82jJ
Wed Jun 15 03:37:48 +0000 2016 @brad_duren @ngeAct64 i meant the Daisy ad -- but I take your point
Wed Jun 15 03:36:28 +0000 2016 @jamespmanley he refused to answer the question which was about leaving not entering. PS i didn't vote to go to war in Iraq -- but Reid did
Wed Jun 15 03:30:27 +0000 2016 @HeatherAften I don't follow. My point is he thinks he can be more effective in critique of Trump
Wed Jun 15 03:28:37 +0000 2016 @jamespmanley right because withdrawing from Iraq has been a huge success and we haven't had to send troops back
Wed Jun 15 03:25:55 +0000 2016 @ngeAct64 @brad_duren that was one ad, not a speech, and it was his own opponent
Wed Jun 15 03:23:20 +0000 2016 @jamespmanley So now you like tough questions? Funny, I remember some angry phone calls.....
Wed Jun 15 02:39:19 +0000 2016 @brucepknight nope i wasn't saying he was wrong in doing so
Wed Jun 15 02:38:55 +0000 2016 @gotrr @brucepknight @cnn i used no such word.
Wed Jun 15 02:31:25 +0000 2016 @HeatherAften @AndyKindler didn't say it did. I said POTUS gave the remarks because he thinks Trump is a danger to the nation.
Wed Jun 15 02:30:27 +0000 2016 @AtticusinCanada no that's not what I said. He gave the remarks because he thinks Trump is a danger to the nation.
Wed Jun 15 01:30:45 +0000 2016 @adambarken this isn't particularly controversial. He thinks he's a better more effective politician and wants to get out there &amp; defeat DJT
Wed Jun 15 01:21:00 +0000 2016 @adambarken is that why their speeches overlapped?
Wed Jun 15 01:18:58 +0000 2016 @brucepknight this wasn't a criticism or a judgment so I don't understand your reaction.

Tue Jun 14 22:07:46 +0000 2016 @lady10314 @allanbrauer dont get the slam, what I was saying was free of judgment
Tue Jun 14 22:03:03 +0000 2016 @EddieLove44 thought it was more that he asked if WJC protested Vietnam war while in USSR

Tue Jun 14 20:31:17 +0000 2016 @mbrooksrjc Goldwater was his opponent and that was a tv ad not an east room speech
Tue Jun 14 20:30:34 +0000 2016 @Liltae1 I President Obama, the president, are usually what I call him but often journalists on later ref might say Mr Obama
Tue Jun 14 20:29:05 +0000 2016 @tommyxtopher I said his motivation for speech was trump speech and comments on Muslims
Tue Jun 14 20:27:08 +0000 2016 @dvora24 Hillary Clinton used the term yesterday. Is she also a Trump supporter?
Tue Jun 14 19:58:36 +0000 2016 @rolandsmartin Trump attacking him had nothing to do with his speech today, WH sources say
Tue Jun 14 19:25:11 +0000 2016 @HawaiiDelilah @KaraCalavera i said he gave it because he thinks Trump is a threat to the nation. The Clinton thing was a side observation
Tue Jun 14 19:20:30 +0000 2016 @chadsdaddy she misrepresented what i said, but whatever, facts be damned
Tue Jun 14 19:19:08 +0000 2016 @Condorian2487 My opinion is irrelevant. we will cover it and Mr Trump's response.
Tue Jun 14 19:12:05 +0000 2016 @Condorian2487 I took a stand against that at the time and took a lot of heat from the Left, so you dont know what youre talking about
Tue Jun 14 18:10:11 +0000 2016 @jsplendor @PoloPersonGwen i specifically said i dont think he was responding to comments about him
Tue Jun 14 18:09:19 +0000 2016 @tomwatson @geokaren @PCalith there was quite obviously NO coordination, their speeches overlapped, his overshadowed hers.
Tue Jun 14 17:54:52 +0000 2016 @geokaren @PCalith @tomwatson was side observation, not the main point, but i do think he thinks he's more effective &amp; is eager to make case
Tue Jun 14 17:53:55 +0000 2016 @BeautyofDamon @Orlijr yes we can, but that works better if one doesnt refer to the other as sounding like a caveman
Tue Jun 14 17:51:54 +0000 2016 @GiannaJax the first part is what i said and was my emphasis. the Clinton point was a side and later observation.
Tue Jun 14 17:49:30 +0000 2016 @BeautyofDamon @Orlijr i never said she was his project. there was nothing gender related in what i said in the slightest
Tue Jun 14 17:48:45 +0000 2016 @Orlijr i expressed my opinion about what the president might be thinking. not me.
Tue Jun 14 17:38:11 +0000 2016 @Orlijr i didnt say i thought she needed anything
Tue Jun 14 17:35:57 +0000 2016 @EncarnacionPj i mentioned no such thing
Tue Jun 14 17:34:40 +0000 2016 @Hubert1Sweet i agree 100% and said so. the clinton note was a side observation.
Tue Jun 14 17:33:11 +0000 2016 @jhtaylorsr36 you have a problem with uncomfortable facts?

Tue Jun 14 16:26:00 +0000 2016 @rosierifka @KatMcKinley thanks. that was an annoying time and the obliviousness of some about the precedent was shocking
Tue Jun 14 16:25:02 +0000 2016 @Ba_Smith_1 @dmartosko @DMRegister opinion writers express opinions, news reporters cover news. politicians arent supposed to punish latter
Tue Jun 14 16:22:37 +0000 2016 @verumserum @dmartosko @SimonTemplarPV @rosierifka i think he means monday's not sunday's
Tue Jun 14 16:21:39 +0000 2016 @CharlesOrtel @HonestAbeNotPC @Dc37Deborah @realDonaldTrump we're a bit focused on covering the worst mass shooting in US history
Tue Jun 14 16:20:25 +0000 2016 @verumserum @SimonTemplarPV @dmartosko @rosierifka not expressing opinion on it, but thats political analysis, not hard news
Tue Jun 14 16:18:54 +0000 2016 @Arianna8927 @rosierifka @dmartosko no. i'm not comparing them. i'm saying theyre all credentialed major media organizations.

Tue Jun 14 16:10:03 +0000 2016 @spiderstumbled @rosierifka @dmartosko oy. i was there. you weren't. all was being coordinated by WH. please stop.
Tue Jun 14 16:08:15 +0000 2016 @spiderstumbled @rosierifka @dmartosko they tried to freeze them out and they said they werent legit &amp; called on shunning.
Tue Jun 14 16:06:13 +0000 2016 @spiderstumbled @rosierifka @dmartosko i was a WH correspondent at the time &amp; involved
Tue Jun 14 16:05:42 +0000 2016 @spiderstumbled @rosierifka @dmartosko not a threat -- they tried to do it and were forced to relent because networks united against it
Tue Jun 14 16:02:54 +0000 2016 @spiderstumbled @rosierifka @dmartosko whatever your thoughts about them the larger point is theyre credentialed &amp; precedent is a bad one
Tue Jun 14 16:02:06 +0000 2016 @spiderstumbled @rosierifka @dmartosko WH said it wasnt a legit news org &amp; shouldnt be treated as such, tried to cut them out of pool intvw

Tue Jun 14 15:59:34 +0000 2016 @SimonTemplarPV @dmartosko @rosierifka it wasnt the same headline and i never said it was. but the interpretation was quite similar
Tue Jun 14 15:52:13 +0000 2016 @GregMitch i havent seen one but that sounds incredible
Tue Jun 14 15:50:12 +0000 2016 @y2raza youll notice he didnt answer that question
Tue Jun 14 15:43:44 +0000 2016 @dmartosko truly unbelievable. you going to reunion?
Tue Jun 14 15:42:29 +0000 2016 @dmartosko yeah @rosierifka pays attention
Tue Jun 14 15:05:04 +0000 2016 @rosierifka @dmartosko yep. And when I pushed WH on its anti Fox campaign I got pilloried by the Left. This was precedent I worried about
Tue Jun 14 14:54:46 +0000 2016 @dmartosko for the rec, at the time I asked Trump to reconsider actions v @DMRegister. And you're right that Post shouldn't be special
Tue Jun 14 14:46:44 +0000 2016 @YaseminMerwede @realDonaldTrump true. But as vile as they are they have killed no one
Tue Jun 14 03:19:40 +0000 2016 @ForeverReagan I say that I work hard to be impartial and tough on both sides, and that John has had a very tough year and seems in pain.

Tue Jun 14 02:26:16 +0000 2016 @az9thdstrct I didn't say that

Mon Jun 13 17:32:57 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG i suppose the significance depends upon whether you're a member of any of those groups
Mon Jun 13 17:32:07 +0000 2016 @Rose_Marie_Holt @fanazer_JTG i'm sorry? you think the fact that Saudis fund globally intolerant extremist madrassas is propaganda?
Mon Jun 13 17:25:38 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG how tolerant is the Saudi government of gays, Christians, Jews, women who want equal rights?
Mon Jun 13 16:56:43 +0000 2016 @thomhickey55 i agree!
Mon Jun 13 16:12:51 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG you havent answered my question about tolerance of whom?
Mon Jun 13 16:11:34 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG we all know the Saudis play both sides, govt helps the west sometimes while allowing funding of terrorism/extremism
Mon Jun 13 16:06:57 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG really? so no intolerance towards gays? Christians? Jews? women who want equal rights?
Mon Jun 13 16:05:50 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG honestly, at this point, the Saudis are fooling no one paying any attention to the spread of violent jihadism.
Mon Jun 13 16:05:17 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG in terms of Saudi-funded extremist madrassas, there are many throughout Pakistan and Uzbekistan, for example. Do you deny it?
