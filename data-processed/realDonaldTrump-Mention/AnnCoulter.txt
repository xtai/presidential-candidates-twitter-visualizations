Sat May 21 21:16:39 +0000 2016 Not saying @TomLlamasABC should be fired for his fib, though many would disagree. But he owes viewers a correction &amp; Broaddrick an apology.
Sat May 21 19:30:39 +0000 2016 Presidents &amp; Popes answer questions. But not @TomLlamasABC, who smears Clinton rape victim Juanita Broaddrick as a liar and won't say why.
Fri May 20 22:08:52 +0000 2016 After reading Broaddrick’s testimny, lib GOP Rep Chris Shays: “I believe that he did rape Broaddrick.” https://t.co/PeLY3JAEuc @TomLlamasABC

Fri May 20 18:04:17 +0000 2016 Would like to keep this btwn us, @TomLlamasABC. No need to involve ABC brass. When was Broaddrick’s rape claim agst Clinton “discredited”???
Fri May 20 18:01:22 +0000 2016 OK @TomLlamas, I was angry last night - deservedly - but this is a serious question: When and how was Broaddrick’s rape claim “discredited”?
Fri May 20 02:53:34 +0000 2016 Would a review of @TomLlamasABC's aired pieces reveal any pattern of belittling women? Llamas: Juanita Broaddrick rape claim "DISCREDITED"!
Fri May 20 02:52:53 +0000 2016 Wondering if @TomLlamasABC has a problem with women.  Llamas: Juanita Broaddrick rape claim was "DISCREDITED"!!!
Fri May 20 02:43:52 +0000 2016 The Clinton playbook on Bill's sexual assaults is, "that's old news!" The @TomLlamasABC playbook is, "that's DISCREDITED"!  Except it hasn't
Fri May 20 02:40:03 +0000 2016 .@TomLlamasABC  Juanita Broaddrick's "rape accusation is decades old and discredited."  This is a Hitler-Goebbels big lie.
Fri May 20 02:37:20 +0000 2016 Explanation #3: @TomLlamasABC can't read. Tom Llamas: Broaddrick rape claim"discredited."
Fri May 20 02:36:40 +0000 2016 Explanation #4: @TomLlamasABC has never heard of Juanita Broaddrick until tonight. Tom Llamas: Broaddrick rape claim"discredited."
Fri May 20 02:33:42 +0000 2016 She told 5 people at the time including her roommate who found her after the rape. How was Juanita Broaddrick "discredited," @TomLlamasABC?
Fri May 20 02:31:31 +0000 2016 Never occurred to me that media's version of Juanita Broaddrick's incredibly well-investigaged claim would be: "discredited!" @TomLlamasABC
Fri May 20 02:29:54 +0000 2016 Explanation #2: @TomLlamasABC thinks it's still 1990 and the public can't get the truth online. Llamas: Rape Broaddrick claim "discredited"
Fri May 20 02:28:27 +0000 2016 Explanation #1: @TomLlamasABC is lazy.
Fri May 20 02:27:43 +0000 2016 AMAZING: @TomLlamasABC states Juanita Broaddrick's rape claim against Clinton was "discredited"? When? How?
