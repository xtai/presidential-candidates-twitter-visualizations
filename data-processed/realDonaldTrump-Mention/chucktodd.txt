Fri Aug 05 16:27:38 +0000 2016 @BillyCorben @WIOD billy, the fact you didn't say anything to get the FCC involved is huge.  That's discipline!
Thu Aug 04 17:28:57 +0000 2016 @ForecasterEnten if he wasn't there would be a slew of leaked NRSC polls telling us so in order to reassure donors.  The silence says a lot

Wed Mar 09 13:28:02 +0000 2016 @JohnTheAlrighty correct.  Trump is not winning black voters, he wins in states (and counties) with higher proportions of an AfAm pop.

Fri Mar 04 20:31:52 +0000 2016 @PaulBegala @CitizenCohn if anywhere, I'd guess KY or LA, the two states that seem to put every Gov't office on the ballot
Fri Mar 04 17:25:43 +0000 2016 @jfudge I'm sorry you are choosing the wrong whiskey.  KY bourbon is the better choice

Thu Feb 25 19:57:32 +0000 2016 @VodkaPundit as usual newsbusters invented a quote I never said.  I argued the media has been getting him.  The party has NOT was my point
Thu Feb 25 19:56:40 +0000 2016 @DTeambanning @NickFondacaro shocked that newsbusters would mislead!
Thu Feb 25 19:56:22 +0000 2016 @DTeambanning @NickFondacaro bizarre conclusion they came to.  I never said that.  I said the we have vetted him.  The party has not.

Mon Feb 22 18:05:51 +0000 2016 @stuartpstevens @elianayjohnson you want to play into the insider v outsider messaging for trump, have the establishment openly cut a deal
Mon Feb 22 16:13:46 +0000 2016 @jonfavs @nickconfessore the media has provided more information about him than rival campaigns. POS and NEG. rivals done squat about trump
Mon Feb 22 16:09:25 +0000 2016 @ConsultReid everything is an hour or two earlier at night and an hour later in the morning
Mon Feb 22 16:08:53 +0000 2016 @ConsultReid central and mountain time zone is the most restful.
Mon Feb 22 15:21:06 +0000 2016 @JoleneAL don't just listen to one POV media outlet.  Because if you spent anytime watching my programs you would know that isn't what I do

Mon Feb 22 00:04:00 +0000 2016 @PatrickRuffini this bodes well for him on March 1
Sun Feb 21 22:44:34 +0000 2016 @VigothePainting @MaxBoot ignore or cover.  Both are fraught with peril
Sun Feb 21 22:43:38 +0000 2016 @MaxBoot @HotlineJosh the media didn't create his consituency
Sun Feb 21 22:38:17 +0000 2016 @conncarroll he's the frontrunner for one of the two major party nominations.   The GOP leadership needs to look in the mirror first
Sun Feb 21 22:36:36 +0000 2016 @MaxBoot @HotlineJosh to simply attempt to blame this on the media is naive.
Sun Feb 21 22:31:58 +0000 2016 @EnLitendJourney that's my fear

Sun Feb 21 01:27:58 +0000 2016 @JonahNRO @meetthepress perhaps a new litmus.  Voters should know, highest scorer should be kicked off the stage.
Sun Feb 21 01:25:06 +0000 2016 @JonahNRO @meetthepress which candidate would score the highest on that weird "test"?
Sun Feb 21 01:20:10 +0000 2016 Shakeup Saturday makes way for "Clarity Sunday".  Lead guests so far for @meetthepress Trump and Sanders.  More to come
Sat Feb 20 23:49:03 +0000 2016 @SassyGabe it may have been unintentional but it could have been Freudian
Sat Feb 20 23:44:09 +0000 2016 @samhwils "exit" not "entrance".  The caucus polls are "entrance" and less accurate
Sat Feb 20 23:23:10 +0000 2016 @GregMitch they are a rare chance to speak to millions of folks at one time thanks to saturation coverage

Fri Feb 19 23:32:20 +0000 2016 On the eve of "Shakeup Saturday," will be assessing on @NBCNightlyNews who has most on the line tomorrow in NV and SC.
Fri Feb 19 22:31:36 +0000 2016 @jpbird the super delegates matter until they don't. Meaning, if Sanders ever truly takes the lead, her lead with Supers will evaporate

Fri Feb 19 14:22:24 +0000 2016 @AlanIAbramowitz @politicalwire careful. You appear to be rooting for us to be an outlier.  Try waiting before judging.
Fri Feb 19 14:15:06 +0000 2016 @AlanIAbramowitz can't call us an outlier yet since no other poll is out totally post GOP debate.
Fri Feb 19 14:14:04 +0000 2016 @Johnnyyumaaz averages are less reliable today because there is a lot of bad polls included now.
Fri Feb 19 14:12:43 +0000 2016 @brettjtalley of course we could be an outlier.  We also are only poll conducted completely post GOP debate.
Fri Feb 19 14:11:34 +0000 2016 @JaySlacks I think they help. And we use very reputable pollsters.  But automatic trashing of a poll before knowing if it is right is ridic
Fri Feb 19 12:22:43 +0000 2016 @BradOnMessage @POLITICO_Steve nothing accelerated the collective skepticism on polling than the advent of the robo polls

Fri Nov 20 12:58:25 +0000 2015 @OldManRiver1800 @AVD911 @MOVEprofPHD @POTUS @MSNBC um, i didn't dismiss, actually FOCUSED on this issue
Thu Nov 19 22:38:33 +0000 2015 @PatrickRuffini @EsotericCD correct.  IVR is a joke due to cell phone issue and well the fact that everyone hangs up on robotic voices!
Thu Nov 19 22:35:45 +0000 2015 @PatrickRuffini @EsotericCD don't mix ivr and online.  Deep dives via online panels can be very good.  IVR, though, seems outdated

Wed Nov 18 22:25:09 +0000 2015 If you were still governor right now, would you ask for a halt of #SyrianRefugees? That's what I'll ask Sen. @MarkWarner, next on #MTPDaily

Mon Nov 16 15:09:20 +0000 2015 @NolteNC guessing you won't be alone wondering that
Mon Nov 16 15:03:14 +0000 2015 On @meetthepress yesterday, POTUS nat sec aide @rhodes44 previewed these remarks. Strategy not changing but there will be "intensification"
Mon Nov 16 14:53:16 +0000 2015 POTUS is now speaking and will take questions for first time since Paris attacks. @NBCNews and @MSNBC live now
Sun Nov 15 21:56:06 +0000 2015 @UnlistedUser1 yeah. Ugly.

Sat Nov 14 20:30:52 +0000 2015 @ByronYork that said, I gotta think this changes things for the next month or so, which will shake things up
Sat Nov 14 20:30:10 +0000 2015 @ByronYork we were having this discussion internally and someone noted that the 07 London attacks didn't change much in the 08 race

Wed Nov 11 04:13:14 +0000 2015 @JohannaHouman assessing how candidates did and how it may impact campaign is neutrality
Wed Nov 11 02:51:27 +0000 2015 @JohnJHarwood true.  Though his name is on a bill that agrees with them.
Wed Nov 11 02:50:08 +0000 2015 Haven't looked at @DomenicoNPR's time chart but guessing Kasich and Fiorina are on top.  Kasich a tad too hot tonight?
Wed Nov 11 02:45:31 +0000 2015 @NolteNC some in the newspaper industry would say new media drove down wages
Tue Nov 10 22:37:04 +0000 2015 #CarlyFiorina defends her lack of a detailed tax plan. I'll ask @MikeNeedham how that's playing with conservatives, next on #MTPDaily.

Sun Nov 08 13:25:57 +0000 2015 @TimJGraham Rubio and Cruz and Huckabee and, fill in the blank. Point is, you biased my comment. Not me.
Sun Nov 08 13:24:39 +0000 2015 @TimJGraham why do you twist what I say.  Did I say Obama or Hillary? I said traditional politicians.
Sun Nov 08 13:22:06 +0000 2015 And on #MTP, we'll take a look at the latest on the downed plane in Russia. What questions remain unanswered? @SenFeinstein joins me live.

Sat Nov 07 21:36:00 +0000 2015 @TimJGraham I see what u are attempting there. But u are barking up wrong tree as usual
Sat Nov 07 21:35:27 +0000 2015 @brookebrower it is weird. I'll grant u that
Sat Nov 07 00:51:39 +0000 2015 @BuzzFeedAndrew @detroitnews that's what they are saying.  He conflated May and Feb
Sat Nov 07 00:51:16 +0000 2015 @jimgeraghty and the other five are named on re prompt. Again, I know some believe this isn't fair but our "support" q says otherwise
Sat Nov 07 00:49:59 +0000 2015 @jimgeraghty I believe others who claim to name all 15 on first ask have shown even lower numbers.  Not sure u r right
Sat Nov 07 00:49:10 +0000 2015 @BuzzFeedAndrew @detroitnews in #MTPDaily Carson manager said Carson was with Westmoreland at Feb banquet
Sat Nov 07 00:46:52 +0000 2015 @jimgeraghty @jmartNYT correct.  But everyone is named.  Our pollsters believe if u name all 15 first, respondents fatigue.
Sat Nov 07 00:42:16 +0000 2015 @JazzShaw @jimgeraghty @jmartNYT correct
Sat Nov 07 00:42:02 +0000 2015 @jimgeraghty @jmartNYT everyone is asked a "could u support" question.  Then we do ballot test of top 10 and on second push, name rest
Sat Nov 07 00:39:16 +0000 2015 @jimgeraghty @jmartNYT not only is your statement not true, but what you tweeted proves. Everyone is named
Fri Nov 06 22:13:02 +0000 2015 President Obama formally rejected #KeystoneXL today. I'll have reaction from @TomSteyer next on #MTPDaily. https://t.co/fYP9XAoUpt

Wed Nov 04 00:07:38 +0000 2015 @Super70sSports @BDayspring Burns
Tue Nov 03 23:29:22 +0000 2015 @wbumper understand your skepticism.  Here is a good explainer about what constitutes a good sample. https://t.co/kjweJjPlk2
Tue Nov 03 23:22:42 +0000 2015 @TaneDanger and yet, it wasn't bad m!
Tue Nov 03 23:21:44 +0000 2015 @wbumper the size of the sample is not as important as how the sample was out together. NBC/WSJ is and always will be the poll gold standard
Tue Nov 03 21:04:24 +0000 2015 @ScottJenningsKY is it too simplistic to pitch this campaign as a "hold your nose" election for the swing voters of KY
Tue Nov 03 20:06:31 +0000 2015 @ScottJenningsKY ah.  Got it.  Riddle me this: has any decent poll had Bevin ahead?
Tue Nov 03 20:05:52 +0000 2015 @ScottJenningsKY and the GOP theory?
Tue Nov 03 20:05:10 +0000 2015 @mmurraypolitics @BlaiseHazelwood point is, every candidate is named cc: @BradOnMessage
Tue Nov 03 19:00:47 +0000 2015 @Toophers you know it.  still upset at bad officiating Duke benefitted from in final two drives. Faux outrage over last play obscures that

Mon Nov 02 15:12:10 +0000 2015 @Timodc @stephenfhayes @Reince exactly. Why shouldn't this loss belong to the staff.  Off a bye week. A BYE week.  Ugh
Mon Nov 02 14:20:59 +0000 2015 @Timodc @stephenfhayes @Reince you had an unfair advantage, you have a team that was prepped after a bye week
Mon Nov 02 14:17:38 +0000 2015 @GrandmaWat @MSNBC @JoeNBC I assure you, he knows nothing about my politics.  He is making this up

Sun Oct 25 22:40:16 +0000 2015 One thing @GoldenAl will deserve credit for is leaving the cupboard full.  He is a class act and a solid person. Good luck coach
Sun Oct 25 21:16:08 +0000 2015 @IngrahamAngle @BillKristol predicting when or if Trump has jumped the shark, has, well, jumped a school of sharks
Sun Oct 25 21:09:02 +0000 2015 @BruceFeldmanCFB @DesmondHoward what's worse for recruiting, rumors of impending change or dealing w it asap
Sun Oct 25 20:36:19 +0000 2015 @BruceFeldmanCFB @DesmondHoward wonder if other coaches who know they could be fired at end of season go this route?

Sat Oct 24 17:06:17 +0000 2015 @MomMilkshake @MarcACaputo if he school cares about the fans, they will act this week.  Letting this continue isn't fair to anyone involved

Wed Oct 14 13:41:31 +0000 2015 @jasonjwilde this is why Ty needs to be used more. He might be a deep threat

Sun Oct 11 16:09:04 +0000 2015 @MatthewBerryTMR well Ryan is it for now.  But don't "drop" Boehner just yet. He may be a starter for longer whether he likes it or not
Sun Oct 11 16:03:00 +0000 2015 @AndrewGripp @meetthepress @imediaethics my view on polling is "everything in moderation"; too much polling for our own good now
Sun Oct 11 16:00:22 +0000 2015 @MatthewBerryTMR so I'm struggling with QB play thanks to Big Ben injury. Can play Bortles or Winston.  What say u? This Winston's week?

Wed Oct 07 23:38:53 +0000 2015 @eldond @ctsotsoros I find it amusing that u view the observation as a positive. Truly bizarre

Wed Oct 07 22:15:36 +0000 2015 @RyanKoncar @meetthepress I even had a bill belichik reference today

Wed Oct 07 20:51:49 +0000 2015 @rolling_2 correct. Easier to be against. There isn't a strong organized pro-trade constituency in either party right now

Sat Oct 03 00:35:52 +0000 2015 @pentastich @JamilSmith I was surprised by the answer.  She implied smaller departments would have hard time complying.

Sat Oct 03 00:25:18 +0000 2015 @briankoppelman I have this theory that we are all born knowing the words to most Eagles songs whether we like them or not
Sat Oct 03 00:22:21 +0000 2015 @erinruberry @capitalweather this is a dumb stat for so many reasons, the biggest: they hurricane center ONLY used female names for years
Sat Oct 03 00:16:14 +0000 2015 @Manny_Navarro @BillyCorben this is exactly how I feel now. I'm tired of complaining. Tired of caring as much as I do. Wish UM cared as much

Tue Sep 29 19:25:50 +0000 2015 @RalstonReports @nickconfessore colorado's demos more reflective than Nevada imo
Tue Sep 29 19:24:43 +0000 2015 @nickconfessore colorado perhaps?
Tue Sep 29 19:18:36 +0000 2015 @whitecollarstl Boehner is more likely to choke Cruz before Pelosi
Tue Sep 29 19:18:08 +0000 2015 @DavidMDrucker so Dan Snyder is to blame for all of this? Dysfunctional patient zero?
Mon Sep 28 23:36:19 +0000 2015 @EBJunkies @chasehughesCSN not a good save.  Ugh.
Mon Sep 28 22:34:08 +0000 2015 Perhaps it isn't surprising but the strongest candidate for the WH is not in the race. More on @NBCNightlyNews and our new NBC/WSJ poll

Sat Sep 19 21:50:53 +0000 2015 @cbfowler this game will help bring back the coaching staff skeptics.  Time for some national love for Kaaya!
Sat Sep 19 21:28:28 +0000 2015 @ohnotherancor @jeffzeleny agree. Classiest fans I've interacted with.
Sat Sep 19 21:20:08 +0000 2015 @loakman true but we've anticipated much of their game plan.  Right place right time in many cases.
Sat Sep 19 20:56:21 +0000 2015 @NoPhotoOps predictable and stupid.
Sat Sep 19 20:31:13 +0000 2015 @jeffzeleny they don't believe yet. This turnout is a direct result of the frustration.  Win today will help.
Sat Sep 19 20:26:13 +0000 2015 @jeffzeleny they don't sell it in BigRed I hope!
Sat Sep 19 18:13:27 +0000 2015 @SeanTrende when you fight the last campaign... this is what happens.
Sat Sep 19 17:46:31 +0000 2015 @Mitch_Stewart @Coach_Riley That wasn't a fair fight. Only time we met where it wasn't. Oregon shd have been in that game in 01/02
Sat Sep 19 17:39:55 +0000 2015 @Mitch_Stewart I don't think either one of us can claim we have been relevant in the last 15 years.
Sat Sep 19 17:38:43 +0000 2015 @Mitch_Stewart It's weird, I have so many good memories of beating Big Red that I don't get fired up. For Canes, it's a coaching staff game
Sat Sep 19 17:35:52 +0000 2015 @jeffzeleny @Mitch_Stewart You are at the game... If I wasn't tied up with this day job... I have 4 good tickets for the game! #GoCanes

Thu Sep 17 01:42:50 +0000 2015 @MotherMaggie209 do u need me to answer that? Guessing you know why
Thu Sep 17 01:16:53 +0000 2015 @HotlineJosh Then as @stuartpstevens said everything we think we know about politics is wrong
Thu Sep 17 01:02:15 +0000 2015 @chrisgeidner well played.... Who's going to defend those talking points, YOU? YOU, Lt. Weinberg?
Thu Sep 17 00:14:29 +0000 2015 @sidrosenberg yeah, might have skipped that
Thu Sep 17 00:07:20 +0000 2015 @BrendanBuck you know who loved a good tan suit  http://t.co/nve1Oxb46W
Thu Sep 17 00:01:00 +0000 2015 @richgalen @FPSantangelo I love FP... He has fun and yet also is great about teaching and explaining nuances of the game. My kids LOVE FP
Wed Sep 16 23:43:56 +0000 2015 @StuPolitics But real Yankee fans don't want to watch this team play in October, do they?
Wed Sep 16 23:24:02 +0000 2015 @RameshPonnuru i thought it was 50 cents/year over 3 years
Wed Sep 16 16:57:42 +0000 2015 @charlescwcooke @topynate you mean the rental car counter clerk anecdote isn't statistically valid? Trouble for some reporters!
Tue Sep 15 20:30:55 +0000 2015 @jack_kiraly18 blackbeans, rice and chicken... if you must know
Tue Sep 15 18:50:20 +0000 2015 @marcorubio always cute when UF and FSU argue about football. Come talk to me when one gets 5 rings. #GoCanes
Sun Sep 13 12:52:45 +0000 2015 And today's @meetthepress panel: @nytdavidbrooks, @Maria_Hinojosa, @ron_fournier &amp; @sarafagen2. #IfItsSunday http://t.co/p0Rk1cVNWf
Sun Sep 13 12:42:02 +0000 2015 Has the summer of Trump, turned into the fall of the GOP establishment? @TomColeOK04 &amp; @JimDeMint join me on #MTP. http://t.co/VTx9Gx01rm
Sun Sep 13 12:24:02 +0000 2015 .@RichardEngel joins me w/ a look at the Syrian refugee crisis &amp; we'll talk to the last US Ambassador to Syria. #MTP http://t.co/7Z51cwPcyf

Sun Sep 13 12:02:06 +0000 2015 This morning, I sit down for a live, wide-ranging interview with @ChrisChristie on @meetthepress. #IfItsSunday http://t.co/EtE4AjdbwD
Sun Sep 13 10:39:40 +0000 2015 Good morning fall! A perfect Sunday setup. Politics this morning with @meetthepress and the NFL in the afternoon. #MTP #GoPackGo
Sat Sep 12 19:10:40 +0000 2015 @So_lo_travels @JSUGamecocks big oops on my part...
Sat Sep 12 19:08:14 +0000 2015 @numberfortyfive was tough to find places that even offered the game
Sat Sep 12 19:06:47 +0000 2015 @numberfortyfive um, no
Sat Sep 12 19:06:28 +0000 2015 @So_lo_travels not knocking... Every school in Florida recruits in Florida as Auburn is finding out
Sat Sep 12 12:29:42 +0000 2015 @craigmelvin u making a statement about UVA v ND?
Sat Sep 12 03:17:20 +0000 2015 @chrisfallica Kaaya and "hope" is about all we have left
Sat Sep 12 03:14:36 +0000 2015 @samflanagan77 that's not a bad idea.
Sat Sep 12 03:08:52 +0000 2015 @chrisfallica it's frustrating and, sadly, familiar.  Odd playcalling. Aggressive at wrong times, predictable in red zone. And no D
Sat Sep 12 03:00:49 +0000 2015 @linusesq will he make Miami great again.
Sat Sep 12 02:16:22 +0000 2015 @Daverosenb these refs seem as lost as the broadcast team.  Maybe they should fly to L.A. and officiate game from there
Sat Sep 12 02:14:04 +0000 2015 Might as well watch this game on mute. Getting no info. How was that play not reviewed. Where's @MikePereira
Sat Sep 12 02:02:51 +0000 2015 @TheSilkLaser sure looked like it on that drive. Btw. Twice Crawford has failed to stop a big run from become bigger
Sat Sep 12 00:35:54 +0000 2015 @michaelriley5 it is a terrible trend. I know there are cost pressures but the point of TV is to bring the viewer there. It sounds sterile
Sat Sep 12 00:25:52 +0000 2015 @bradbury1958 I'll call Miami games for free if they want.
Sat Sep 12 00:24:38 +0000 2015 @AlexHerbst25 I flipped to that game last night during Pats-Steelers ad breaks and now I know why the announcing sounded weird then
Thu Sep 10 13:44:46 +0000 2015 @matthewjdowd and even higher if the parties look like they may settle on Clinton and Bush
Wed Sep 09 01:39:40 +0000 2015 @gecomm a good outing but couldn't get to the 7th.  That's not insignificant t. Great starters get thru 7
Wed Sep 09 01:38:18 +0000 2015 @zestyteich sure he was. Couldn't get to the 7th.  Would have been fine if the pen was better
Wed Sep 09 01:36:45 +0000 2015 @NKingofDC @JohnFeehery Williams helped create the chemistry and psychological problems the pen has
Tue Sep 08 20:29:45 +0000 2015 @taylormarsh @MSNBC later this month.
Sun Sep 06 15:19:00 +0000 2015 @Simas44 @mmurraypolitics @maristpoll  yes. It is all there
Sun Sep 06 12:52:04 +0000 2015 So there's something new in the open of @meetthepress. Tune in to hear the new "voice" of #MTP. #IfItsSunday
Sun Sep 06 12:34:01 +0000 2015 This Sunday's panelist @JoyAnnReid writes for @MSNBC: Will @JoeBiden run or not in #2016? http://t.co/5vHy3tMuJn http://t.co/Ip5c9FsO2B
Sun Sep 06 12:12:02 +0000 2015 Today's @meetthepress roundtable: @HughHewitt, @DorisKGoodwin, @TomBrokaw &amp; @JoyAnnReid  #WelcomeToSunday http://t.co/2rEKU0V7CF

Sat Sep 05 21:10:25 +0000 2015 @HumphreyBogart @JoeTrippi If it takes place in Key Largo, I'm in!
Sat Sep 05 18:23:28 +0000 2015 @GramBradsworth am I crazy enough to compete with @CollegeGameDay? Answer is no. cc: @cbfowler
Sat Sep 05 18:22:07 +0000 2015 One of the better explanations of why the establishment GOP candidates are struggling. From @daveweigel http://t.co/d13xXjD8xN
Thu Sep 03 20:15:22 +0000 2015 This Sunday on @meetthepress,  I'll have an exclusive interview with Gen. Colin Powell. #IfItsSunday http://t.co/sd5X5uF69l
Thu Sep 03 13:26:52 +0000 2015 @Manny_Navarro sadly correct.
Thu Sep 03 13:04:54 +0000 2015 @Manny_Navarro four losses is the definition of an UNsuccessful season.  Hope you are wrong.  Golden can't go 0 for against FSU/Clem
Thu Sep 03 12:17:22 +0000 2015 @chrislhayes best scenario for Jake, sports writers splitting their Dodger pitcher votes.  Kershaw is matching Koufax in season Ks!
Tue Sep 01 16:26:51 +0000 2015 @toppscards tempting.  Next time we will take you up on it!
Tue Sep 01 15:50:33 +0000 2015 Hey @toppscards we just stopped by the NYC hqs!  Sadly, no place to get cards! http://t.co/urz4DgruKU
Tue Sep 01 11:27:52 +0000 2015 @Lwme07 @TODAYshow we spent all night
Mon Aug 31 22:18:36 +0000 2015 @marybschneider @stuartpstevens @MarkHalperin @goodnewsgoddess as long as someone carries a phone, they carry a tracking device
Mon Aug 31 14:42:44 +0000 2015 @danpfeiffer @neeratanden point is, he needs this field to stay large. History says it won't
Mon Aug 31 14:38:10 +0000 2015 @danpfeiffer @neeratanden he has 100 percent name ID and can't break 35.
Sun Aug 30 21:13:55 +0000 2015 @rspringertampa non rigged gambling is still gambling
Sun Aug 30 21:13:09 +0000 2015 @DanKortebein yup. Next great state budget crisis around country will spark it
Sun Aug 30 21:12:14 +0000 2015 @immattryan @GottaSayItRadio seriously?
Sun Aug 30 21:10:48 +0000 2015 @pastornick it really is silly to pretend daily fantasy isn't gambling
Sun Aug 30 20:49:16 +0000 2015 @jtuckermartin @LaneCBS6 sounds like a Trumpism
Sun Aug 30 18:06:38 +0000 2015 @WayneSlater @MSNBC and Huckabee used it as a one liner during debates in 07/08
Sun Aug 30 12:32:04 +0000 2015 Today's @meetthepress roundtable: @mattbai, @MHarrisPerry, @helenecooper, &amp; GOP strategist Steve Schmidt. #WelcomeToSunday
Sun Aug 30 12:05:04 +0000 2015 .@trymainelee covered Katrina for the NOLA paper. He went back to revisit his reporting &amp; a special woman for #MTP. http://t.co/jBWij2SbR3
Sun Aug 30 12:02:06 +0000 2015 A little light pre-show reading is the piece @Gladwell wrote for The @NewYorker on the people who left New Orleans: http://t.co/3E0wePRhGc
Sun Aug 30 11:52:01 +0000 2015 It's been a year since @potus announced a new strategy against ISIS. What's working and what's not.   I'll check in with @RichardEngel.
Sun Aug 30 11:47:01 +0000 2015 And I'm joined this morning by Ambassador @brett_mcgurk who is part of the process to devise and carry-out the strategy against ISIS. #MTP
Sun Aug 30 11:42:04 +0000 2015 .@ScottWalker on the #IranDeal, religious liberty, his WI record, new @Bucks stadium, this morning on @meetthepress. http://t.co/jtUUkch4fG
Sun Aug 30 11:35:06 +0000 2015 This morning on @meetthepress, I'm going to take a closer look at how @realDonaldTrump is framing the race. #MTP http://t.co/c2Zp2wGEwy
Fri Aug 28 22:15:07 +0000 2015 @DelstallDelbert @BrandonRittiman @cologop we were joking of course. But it really is a shame that CO GOPers are being disenfranchised
Fri Aug 28 19:11:23 +0000 2015 @mmurraypolitics good reminder about super delegates. They will go with who wins.  They won't stick with a candidate that starts losing
Fri Aug 28 17:17:51 +0000 2015 @matthewjdowd @ForecasterEnten true. Btw. Our climate is just different. Local poll respondents react more nationally now
Fri Aug 28 17:15:09 +0000 2015 @ForecasterEnten @matthewjdowd there wasn't as much state polling in 08 but I bet Giuliani led in many of them in 07
Fri Aug 28 13:15:21 +0000 2015 @mmurraypolitics @AntDeRosa I remember getting a call asking what it was like in that Dean room.  And initial reaction was "what scream"?
Fri Aug 28 12:21:33 +0000 2015 @vincefrillici Clintons left the DNC in much better shape then than Obama apparently will for 2016
Fri Aug 28 12:15:20 +0000 2015 Hey @morningmoneyben, when was the last time a GDP estimate was THIS off? http://t.co/KTzNR5g4lt
Thu Aug 27 21:20:19 +0000 2015 @RameshPonnuru he ran it, right!?!? Forgot about that
Thu Aug 27 00:11:18 +0000 2015 .@TheRevAl welcome to Sundays.  Great to have your voice as part of this important day of conversation.
Mon Aug 24 12:21:43 +0000 2015 @RuthlessRoc @JonahNRO @HardcoreHistory I second this.  But it is a commitment. 15 hours on WWI. But worth it
Sun Aug 23 12:47:56 +0000 2015 @greenfield64 what you are implying is that you know exactly what will happen in Dec 2016.
Sun Aug 23 12:42:05 +0000 2015 Introducing this Sunday's @meetthepress panel: @amigoaguilar, @SusanPage, @amyewalter, &amp; @RalstonReports http://t.co/rTn2JaGT0w #IfItsSunday
Sun Aug 23 12:33:05 +0000 2015 Also, I sent #MTP producer @joetoohey to talk to @realDonaldTrump supporters in Mobile, AL. See what they had to say on @meetthepress.
Sun Aug 23 12:32:02 +0000 2015 How do you run against Trump? I'll ask 2 GOP strategists, @alexcast &amp; Charlie Black, on #MTP this morning. http://t.co/MCyQdztbsy
Sun Aug 23 12:22:03 +0000 2015 I'll talk to @GovHowardDean &amp; Peter Hart abt the state of Clinton's campaign &amp; the possibility of a Biden run. #MTP http://t.co/fCZMwMpfHs
Sun Aug 23 12:15:07 +0000 2015 .@JerryBrownGov on Clinton's email controversy -- vampire that needs staking: http://t.co/LW9doc8uTz. More on #MTP http://t.co/uAEHTAtSa2
Sun Aug 23 12:02:04 +0000 2015 Here's @carlyfiorina's take on @hillaryclinton: http://t.co/qdpLLQfxMv  See more on @meetthepress this morning. http://t.co/gFv09NzQQk
Sat Aug 22 16:13:00 +0000 2015 @UMBrowardAlumni @Canes_Wear done!
Sat Aug 22 16:12:25 +0000 2015 @LTorbin @YahooForde @Super70sSports Chiefs I believe was a yellowish color, was the one I always accidentally used. Looked like a reg no2
Sat Aug 22 16:06:13 +0000 2015 @YahooForde @Super70sSports it had to be an emergency for me to decide to actually break up the set and use one
Fri Aug 21 12:20:10 +0000 2015 .@murphymike goes public w/ what many had been insinuating, Bush camp sees one Trump upside, he hurts other anti-Jebs http://t.co/JNhDVcAgQh
Thu Aug 20 17:34:35 +0000 2015 @rydo76 @EdMigs sapp or Kennedy for Emtman.  Shockey for Hudson at TE.  Irvin for Biletnikoff though don't love that trade
Thu Aug 20 17:32:28 +0000 2015 @Toophers didn't love making the case against Rice
Thu Aug 20 17:21:05 +0000 2015 @Kenyon19_BR not blind at all. But to have just one Miami player from the 80s 90s or 00s combined is a mistake
Thu Aug 20 17:09:25 +0000 2015 @Kenyon19_BR oh. And clinton Portis and Jeremy Shockley all shared touches. Andre J alone at Pitt would have been as dominant
Thu Aug 20 17:00:53 +0000 2015 @Kenyon19_BR Santana moss was on the other side. Who was on the other side at Pitt
Thu Aug 20 16:59:18 +0000 2015 @Toophers actually. You know who might not belong on this list.  Jerry Rice. Obviously greatest of all time in nfl. But college?
Thu Aug 20 16:54:53 +0000 2015 @Eddie_Dynamite Hey, I'm also doing an unofficial #tweettheU right now about Miami getting hosed by these folks! http://t.co/jxdODUCATN
Thu Aug 20 16:53:01 +0000 2015 @Toophers Carter should be on that list; and I'd have him ahead of Larry. Folks forget how talented he was
Thu Aug 20 16:51:59 +0000 2015 @zachgeis He is still recruiting great talent, see this year's NFL draft. Now, it's about ON THE FIELD results
Thu Aug 20 16:50:47 +0000 2015 @sbprice @jayrosen_nyu Of course, I get the barrage effect of all coverage. But to simply chalk this up to media and not voters is naive
Thu Aug 20 16:50:05 +0000 2015 @hornfan62 @SBNation I wouldn't argue with Vince Young. Just saying Dorsey deserves consideration if Tebow is standardbearer
Thu Aug 20 16:48:53 +0000 2015 @JonBlumenthal and so it begins...
Thu Aug 20 16:48:43 +0000 2015 @Barber_izm4 @Kenyon19_BR In hindsight, Dorsey was the coach on the field of that team; not just the QB
Thu Aug 20 16:47:49 +0000 2015 @griffj25 Andre Johnson or Shockey deserve serious consideration
Thu Aug 20 16:47:02 +0000 2015 @Toophers Oh, and I think Miami's TEs deserve at least one of the top slots.
Thu Aug 20 16:45:58 +0000 2015 @Toophers Sapp or Cortez Kennedy deserve a spot in the top 6 of DTs... And look at Miami's WRs of all time, one belongs in that top 6
Thu Aug 20 16:34:14 +0000 2015 @Ryan_Mueller And I can match that list and then some with Miami players (many of whom reside in Canton)
Thu Aug 20 16:33:07 +0000 2015 @chrisFnicholson season starts soon... Hope springs eternal. #GoCanes #noexcuses
Thu Aug 20 16:32:27 +0000 2015 @theharryshearer Ah, you just picked at one of my peeves... the NYC-centricity of allowing locals to go national
Thu Aug 20 16:26:40 +0000 2015 @SBNation why is that even controversial. Of course, I'd argue Ken Dorsey deserves similar treatment. College record is absurdly good
Thu Aug 20 15:39:57 +0000 2015 @Domenic_Re another point I make to all the campaigns. Don't be media shy
Thu Aug 20 15:39:24 +0000 2015 @brians_neck agreed
Thu Aug 20 15:39:03 +0000 2015 @dcosby1975 ok, apology accepted
Thu Aug 20 15:38:47 +0000 2015 @dcosby1975 at least fix the typo
