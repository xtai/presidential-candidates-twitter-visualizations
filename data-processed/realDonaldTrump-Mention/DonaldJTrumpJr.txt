Tue Mar 29 15:04:39 +0000 2016 @daveweigel fair enough... My point was more to the statistical analysis. Many choices vs very few
Tue Mar 29 15:01:32 +0000 2016 @MarkSBII that's what they said when he entered the race too.

Sat Mar 12 04:48:09 +0000 2016 @FroyoLuke but when asked they did not have an answer as to why. Likely because they were brought there simply to protest.
Sat Mar 12 04:44:06 +0000 2016 @Ebbiejoy_taylor what are you talking about? John and I went to the same school at the same time. Nice try.
Sat Mar 12 04:10:01 +0000 2016 @Slytherin_Lou it is laughable when someone doesn't know what they're actually protesting.
Sat Mar 12 03:33:47 +0000 2016 @AnthonyCumia I saw 5 protesters interviewed and they didn't even know why they were there.
Sat Mar 12 02:38:29 +0000 2016 Conservatives just remember the far left set this up tonight because they know @realDonaldTrump is the only one that can beat Hillary!

Sun Jan 24 00:31:53 +0000 2016 @Casperventer no I got your point. You think a sign will influence the decisions of someone willing to commit those crimes. Well thought out
Sat Jan 23 23:19:27 +0000 2016 @Casperventer no it's not. Read what they did that's not "cultural" give me a break! Insane that anyone could even attempt that argument.
