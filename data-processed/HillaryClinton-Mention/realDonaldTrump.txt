Mon May 16 22:13:20 +0000 2016 No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious &amp; libelous story they did on me.
Mon May 16 22:12:53 +0000 2016 The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.
Mon May 16 21:50:40 +0000 2016 Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends.  https://t.co/qkK3LJPoQQ

Mon May 16 15:25:02 +0000 2016 With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud!
Mon May 16 13:24:21 +0000 2016 A political commentator for @cnn, which I no longer watch, said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries." I set all-time record!
Mon May 16 13:12:38 +0000 2016 Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied
Mon May 16 13:09:26 +0000 2016 The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!
Mon May 16 11:00:58 +0000 2016 That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!
Mon May 16 01:25:54 +0000 2016 The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration.
Sun May 15 19:11:30 +0000 2016 Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST!
Sun May 15 19:06:18 +0000 2016 Wow, I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that!
Sun May 15 11:32:14 +0000 2016 Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest!

Fri Dec 11 21:49:27 +0000 2015 Tom Ridge is a failed 'Bushy' &amp; PA Governor. Him &amp; his friend @KarlRove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary- nobody listens!
Fri Dec 11 13:04:16 +0000 2015 .@chucktodd is a nice guy , but just hopeless. He knows so little about politics and, in particular, winning!  I fixed his rating problem.
Fri Dec 11 12:59:25 +0000 2015 .@Morning_Joe just went off the rails. I will beat Hillary easily - she does not want to run against me. I am tuning them out, waste of time
Fri Dec 11 12:53:34 +0000 2015 .@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open - more fun that way!
Fri Dec 11 12:49:46 +0000 2015 Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so, he will fall like all others. Will be easy!
Fri Dec 11 12:45:08 +0000 2015 .@Morning_Joe is so off on Iowa, which I am leading big in new @CNN poll. I will win Iowa. Also, I beat Hillary easily!
