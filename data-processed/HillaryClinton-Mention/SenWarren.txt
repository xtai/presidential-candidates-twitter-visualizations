Fri Aug 12 15:04:17 +0000 2016 .@usedgov didn’t fall for the scheme. To other shady #4profit schools, @JohnKingatED's right: Don’t waste your time. https://t.co/sPqrPE3HDJ
Fri Aug 12 15:03:32 +0000 2016 A Utah-based #4profit college tried to convert to a bogus nonprofit school to skirt @usedgov for-profit rules &amp; oversight. Lame trick.
Thu Aug 11 20:20:02 +0000 2016 The entire MA Congressional delegation supports @MassAGO’s enforcement of our state laws banning assault weapons. https://t.co/4ndp6414An
Thu Aug 11 19:17:10 +0000 2016 Bad news: @DEAHQ refused to reschedule marijuana. This has wide implications for med research, law enforcement &amp; business.
Thu Aug 11 19:16:28 +0000 2016 Good news: @DEAHQ is eliminating outdated barriers to marijuana research. Common sense given growing pool of med marijuana patients.
Wed Aug 10 16:16:15 +0000 2016 Read my op-ed w/ @SenWhitehouse on @GOP’s unprecedented attack on free speech &amp; states’ rights for big oil donors: https://t.co/gIRepwVimr
Wed Aug 10 16:15:18 +0000 2016 When oil-backed @GOP abuse power to stifle state climate change investigations, they don’t advance the 1st Amendment – they trample on it.
Tue Aug 09 17:56:18 +0000 2016 Who does the @USChamber work for? Big corps who stash profits overseas, leaving small biz to pay taxes instead. https://t.co/Tm46RYAIhC
Tue Aug 09 16:52:06 +0000 2016 More from @nytimes &amp; @TheEye_NECIR on think tank conflicts. Some can be an expert on anything for the right price. https://t.co/3t55RAI7r6
Sun Aug 07 16:55:36 +0000 2016 Read this @nytimes story on how corporations fund "independent" think tank research to push their interests: https://t.co/jcAcgljYz0
Thu Aug 04 22:15:22 +0000 2016 .@HouseGOP time &amp; again puts Big Oil interests over every other issue. Proud to stand w/ @MassAGO. Let her investigate &amp; see the facts.
Thu Aug 04 22:14:51 +0000 2016 Every MA delegation member signed a letter to @LamarSmithTX21 w/ concerns about this disgraceful pander to Big Oil. https://t.co/fUl9DZ1liu
Thu Aug 04 22:07:45 +0000 2016 GOP says @MassAGO’s investigation is a war on 1st Amendment rights. But companies don’t have a right to defraud their investors &amp; consumers.
Thu Aug 04 22:05:48 +0000 2016 The @HouseGOP claims to be for states’ rights, but they don’t seem to know the Constitution gives STATES power to enforce STATE law.
Thu Aug 04 22:04:45 +0000 2016 Sci Chairman @LamarSmithTX21 issued subpoenas to @MassAGO Healey &amp; @AGSchneiderman— a prime example of @HouseGOP abuse of power.
Thu Aug 04 22:03:48 +0000 2016 The GOP-led @HouseScience Committee is helping @exxonmobil deny the reality of climate change.
Thu Aug 04 15:46:12 +0000 2016 Today in the @NEJM I write about the need for transparency in our clinical trial system to improve people's health: https://t.co/l6hBWp53Hk
Thu Jul 21 17:23:10 +0000 2016 Yesterday @MassAGO took an important step to stop the spread of lethal assault-style weapons. Read more here: https://t.co/ElPNcmPTf5
Wed Jul 20 15:58:34 +0000 2016 Let me offer you a word of advice, @LamarSmithTX21 &amp; your @exxonmobil buddies: you picked a fight with the wrong state &amp; the wrong AG.
Wed Jul 20 15:56:08 +0000 2016 For the @GOP, states’ rights only apply for restricting voting rights or regulating women’s bodies. Not investigating climate change fraud.
Wed Jul 20 15:54:16 +0000 2016 .@LamarSmithTX21 says he “takes very seriously his obligation to uphold &amp; defend the Constitution” — but apparently not the 10th Amendment.
Wed Jul 20 15:50:42 +0000 2016 Now @exxonmobil got the Chair of the @HouseScience Committee — a TX Republican who has taken $675k from oil &amp; gas — to subpoena @MassAGO.
Wed Jul 20 15:49:43 +0000 2016 First @exxonmobil tried to stop @MassAGO by suing Healey in a TX court &amp; attacking her integrity because she’s doing her job.
Wed Jul 20 15:48:59 +0000 2016 .@MassAGO Maura Healey is investigating whether @exxonmobil broke state laws by knowingly misleading people about climate change.
Wed Jul 20 15:48:23 +0000 2016 Want to see how giant corporations rig the system? Look at what @exxonmobil is doing to intimidate @MassAGO to stop fraud investigation.
Thu Jul 14 22:01:46 +0000 2016 The @CFPB is proof that government CAN work for the people. #ConsumersCount https://t.co/kAUI4UG4pS
Thu Jul 14 19:24:36 +0000 2016 11 Senate Dems &amp; I sent a letter to @usedgov, @FTC, @CFPB &amp; @DeptVetAffairs about fake schools like Trump “U”: https://t.co/HqofUVw95d
Tue Jul 12 17:03:57 +0000 2016 The @HouseGOP should be ashamed. The last thing Congress should be doing is giving homophobic Americans a license to discriminate.
Tue Jul 12 17:00:28 +0000 2016 I’m not joking: @HouseGOP are holding a hearing right now about making it easier for people to discriminate against #LGBT Americans.
Tue Jul 12 16:59:45 +0000 2016 Our country has seen too many tragedies this month. So what are the @HouseGOP doing right now? Holding a hearing to legalize hate.
Tue Jul 05 21:11:18 +0000 2016 Today @MarkWarner, @RepCummings &amp; I sent letters to derivative clearing orgs about resolution plans if they fail. https://t.co/ly5J2cZH5V
Wed Jun 29 20:19:44 +0000 2016 Sen @MarkWarner, @RepCummings &amp; I filed a new bill today to strengthen oversight of derivatives &amp; prevent bailouts: https://t.co/cVsxjYGsnL
Wed Jun 29 15:59:33 +0000 2016 In just a few minutes I’ll be speaking about #antitrust policy at the @NewAmerica Open Markets program. Watch: https://t.co/FyaxpS708r
Wed Jun 29 15:58:45 +0000 2016 Today, @amprog released a report on why our country needs a progressive competition policy: https://t.co/CLZtORmaZ5
Wed Jun 29 15:57:34 +0000 2016 The @rooseveltinst recently released a very thorough report on corporate, financial &amp; monopoly power: https://t.co/TkdattFbaa
Tue Jun 28 19:45:46 +0000 2016 Every day @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP don't take #Zika seriously, more ppl get sick. 481 pregnant women in US states &amp; territories have Zika NOW.
Tue Jun 28 19:44:36 +0000 2016 Is this some sort of sick joke, @SenateGOP? Is the #Zika virus — and our country’s response to this emergency — just a game to you?!
Tue Jun 28 19:42:53 +0000 2016 The GOP #Zika bill cuts Senate levels of @DeptVetAffairs funding by $500M – money for VA hospital maintenance &amp; raises for doctors &amp; nurses.
Tue Jun 28 19:41:14 +0000 2016 The GOP #Zika bill blocks @PPFA from receiving birth control grant money that would help poor women with Zika avoid having deformed babies.
Tue Jun 28 19:39:08 +0000 2016 The GOP #Zika bill provides $800 million less in funding than the @WhiteHouse requested. Money we need for prevention &amp; treatment.
Tue Jun 28 19:38:15 +0000 2016 Then while @HouseDemocrats fought for gun violence votes at #NoBillNoBreak, the @HouseGOP jammed through a terrible #Zika bill at 3am.
Tue Jun 28 19:37:19 +0000 2016 4 months ago, the @WhiteHouse requested $1.9B to fight #Zika. Dems asked the GOP to act – and the GOP dragged their feet.
Tue Jun 28 19:36:40 +0000 2016 My blood is boiling over the pathetic, dishonest &amp; malicious #Zika funding bill that @SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; the GOP just tried to pass.
Thu Jun 23 01:45:51 +0000 2016 .@SpeakerRyan &amp; the @HouseGOP: You should be ashamed of yourselves for your totally corrupt priorities. People are watching.
Thu Jun 23 01:44:29 +0000 2016 .@HouseDemocrats: Please vote NO on this veto override. We weren’t sent here to do dirty work for Wall St’s armies of lawyers &amp; lobbyists.
Thu Jun 23 01:42:56 +0000 2016 When @SpeakerRyan turns off the cameras, the @HouseGOP gets to work — both for the @NRA AND for Wall Street. Unbelievable.
Thu Jun 23 01:41:58 +0000 2016 .@SpeakerRyan scheduled a vote tonight to kill a new @USDOL rule that protects workers’ retirement savings from shady financial advisers.
Thu Jun 23 01:40:20 +0000 2016 After a whole day of #NoBillNoBreak, @HouseGOP is instead moving on a vote to make it easier for retirement advisers to cheat ppl. Really.
Thu Jun 23 00:53:48 +0000 2016 Sorry about blocking the livestream for a sec there! Just happy to see my friend @RepDuckworth at #NoBillNoBreak. https://t.co/rKjyWGrgGe
Thu Jun 23 00:28:12 +0000 2016 Massachusetts knows: America — and #NoBillNoBreak — runs on @DunkinDonuts. #birthdaydonuts #holdthefloor https://t.co/XG1wzU5q41
Wed Jun 22 20:25:45 +0000 2016 The @HouseGOP may run from a vote for common-sense gun measures, but they can’t hide. #NoBillNoBreak https://t.co/TMnjPmJClS
Wed Jun 22 20:17:29 +0000 2016 .@RepKClark has done a terrific job putting this #NoBillNoBreak sit-in together. Proud to stand (&amp; sit) by her side. https://t.co/r3kMgUkQgz
Wed Jun 22 20:14:58 +0000 2016 Great to also see @mikecapuano, @RepRichardNeal &amp; @USRepKeating at the sit-in. The MA delegation sits in solidarity. #NoBillNoBreak
Wed Jun 22 19:23:00 +0000 2016 Nowhere I'd rather spend my bday than the House floor w/ @repjohnlewis for gun control. #NoBillNoBreak #goodtrouble https://t.co/nTzrO9c0Fk

Wed Jun 22 17:58:35 +0000 2016 Hero @repjohnlewis is leading a sit-in on gun violence &amp; @SpeakerRyan shut off the camera so you can’t watch. Shameful. #NoBillNoBreak
Tue Jun 21 22:06:50 +0000 2016 .@HouseDemocrats must continue to stand strong against these @GOP efforts to help Wall Street at the expense of working families.
Tue Jun 21 22:05:45 +0000 2016 The @HouseGOP bill weakens the @CFPB, delays payday lending &amp; forced arbitration clause rules, undermines regulators &amp; cuts SEC funding.
Tue Jun 21 22:04:10 +0000 2016 Next up on the @HouseGOP’s agenda to help Wall Street: A vote on a gov funding bill chock-full of items on the big banks’ wish list.
Tue Jun 21 17:55:30 +0000 2016 After Orlando, @US_FDA should implement a risk-based blood donor policy that doesn't discriminate against LGBT men. https://t.co/ThrpkBIAEf
Mon Jun 20 23:08:01 +0000 2016 .@ChrisMurphyCT said it right: The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.
Mon Jun 20 23:06:42 +0000 2016 Ashamed &amp; disgusted that the Senate works for the @NRA &amp; not the majority of Americans who support basic solutions to stop gun violence.
Thu Jun 16 00:47:58 +0000 2016 This is the cover of the @BostonGlobe tomorrow - &amp; they are 100% correct. #filibuster #holdthefloor https://t.co/wO1CicfoWk

Thu Jun 09 16:54:13 +0000 2016 That’s why I’m joining my fellow @SenateDems today to introduce the #WethePeople Act. https://t.co/Qs5iTUueav
Wed Jun 08 21:55:12 +0000 2016 The American people deserve better than @SenateMajLdr &amp; the @SenateGOP’s judicial blockade. Watch: https://t.co/YWzxaZ9c8e #DoYourJob
Wed Jun 08 21:54:13 +0000 2016 I wish I could say I’m surprised, but @SenateMajLdr &amp; @SenateGOP keep court seats empty as long as possible to hamstring @POTUS.
Wed Jun 08 21:53:24 +0000 2016 I called for immediate votes on 15 judicial nominees. @SenateMajLdr objected. 9 nominees? No. 4 nominees? No. Just 1 nominee? No.
Wed Jun 08 21:52:35 +0000 2016 I took @SenateGOP's deal: 2 other judges confirmed if I’d keep quiet. Then today I went back to the floor to call for votes on the 15.
Wed Jun 08 21:51:39 +0000 2016 I wanted to request votes for the 15 District Court noms on Monday – but @SenateMajLdr didn’t want to be embarrassed so he cut me a deal.
Wed Jun 08 21:50:47 +0000 2016 The @senjudiciary Committee has cleared 15 nominees for federal District Courts. Those nominees are still waiting for confirmation votes.
Tue Jun 07 18:25:43 +0000 2016 Read my op-ed with @SenSchumer &amp; @SenWhitehouse opposing SS trustee nominee Blahous &amp; SEC nominee Peirce: https://t.co/lSAUyjR88Y
Tue Jun 07 16:34:49 +0000 2016 A marriage between @realDonaldTrump’s toxic racism &amp; @RepHensarling’s Wall Street giveaways is a path to ruin for our country.
Tue Jun 07 16:33:40 +0000 2016 In fact, @RepHensarling met with @realDonaldTrump today to pitch him on his new plan to gut Wall St reform – including the @CFPB.
Tue Jun 07 16:32:47 +0000 2016 Today in the Banking Committee I spoke about @RepHensarling’s new bill I call the Wet Kiss for Wall Street Act. https://t.co/qCTweAI770
Mon Jun 06 17:59:14 +0000 2016 .@SenateGOP: Have a hearing and a vote on #SCOTUS nominee Merrick Garland. Ditch the extremism and #DoYourJob.
Mon Jun 06 17:58:13 +0000 2016 The GOP says if gov isn’t working for them &amp; their rich buddies, they won’t let it work for anyone. That extremism got us @realDonaldTrump.
Mon Jun 06 17:55:50 +0000 2016 .@SenateGOP obstruct @POTUS's nominees just because they don’t like the guy doing the nominating. Read my report: https://t.co/MfZfye5qVM
Mon Jun 06 17:54:41 +0000 2016 Gov is supposed to work for all of us. But when it comes to making sure courts &amp; watchdogs are staffed, @SenateGOP refuse to do their jobs.
Thu Jun 02 14:40:28 +0000 2016 Congress wasn’t elected to help predatory lenders. If anyone tries to block or delay the @CFPB payday rules, it’s time to fight back hard.
Thu Jun 02 14:36:44 +0000 2016 The @CFPB’s new rule cracks down on tricks payday lenders use to generate thousands in interest &amp; fees from ppl trapped in cycles of debt.
Thu Jun 02 14:35:47 +0000 2016 It’s another good day: The @CFPB just took a big step to protect consumers from predatory payday loans. https://t.co/KtnxEk4F1E
Wed May 25 22:42:55 +0000 2016 We’ll gear up &amp; fight back, like we’ve done so many times before. We won’t let the @CFPB be destroyed by Wall St &amp; their Washington friends.
Wed May 25 22:40:59 +0000 2016 The @CFPB has handled 900k complaints &amp; forced big banks to return $11B to people they cheated. @HouseGOP can’t stand gov that works.
Wed May 25 22:39:32 +0000 2016 .@HouseAppropsGOP voted today to hamstring the @CFPB &amp; make it tougher for the cops on Wall Street to do their jobs.
Wed May 25 21:02:53 +0000 2016 Student loans make it tough for ppl to buy homes. Thrilled @nardotrealtor supports my #bankonstudents refi bill. https://t.co/HbGNXlhi6r

Tue May 24 14:24:19 +0000 2016 Yesterday I reminded the @SenateGOP: We weren’t sent here to work for Wall Street &amp; their armies of lawyers &amp; lobbyists.
Tue May 24 14:23:25 +0000 2016 Today the @SenateGOP is voting for a proposal to make it EASIER for Wall Street to cheat Americans out of the retirement savings.
Mon May 23 19:10:32 +0000 2016 This @BostonGlobe story shows that the student debt crisis is real – and it's even worse than we imagined. https://t.co/o5A0bzg21E

Wed May 18 17:58:30 +0000 2016 Read my office’s report on how @USDOL’s new overtime rule will make a big difference for working families: https://t.co/R28FjGtX0f
Wed May 18 17:57:09 +0000 2016 Big companies &amp; trade associations flooded @USDOL with criticism of this overtime change, but workers spoke up too — and @USDOL listened.
Wed May 18 17:55:38 +0000 2016 .@USDOL’s new overtime rule guarantees anyone earning less than $47,476/yr will qualify for OT — nearly 40% of full-time salaried workers.
Wed May 18 17:55:00 +0000 2016 Anyone who puts in a hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay. Today @USDOL released an overtime pay rule that helps make that happen.
Tue May 17 18:24:50 +0000 2016 #Zika is coming, &amp; if the @SenateGOP blocks Congress from protecting people, they must accept responsibility for devastating consequences.
Tue May 17 18:21:26 +0000 2016 Most @SenateGOP still oppose fully funding #Zika response &amp; want to gut our public health infrastructure to say they're tough on spending.
Tue May 17 18:20:39 +0000 2016 Months after @POTUS requested nearly $2B to fight #Zika, the @SenateGOP will finally let us vote on funding options today.
Mon May 16 18:26:48 +0000 2016 Today’s the last day to nominate someone to attend the @WhiteHouse United #StateofWomen Summit in DC: https://t.co/UUnqku3g9j

Thu May 12 19:22:14 +0000 2016 Should we really be surprised @realDonaldTrump &amp; @SpeakerRyan had a good talk? The GOP is already lined up behind his extreme policies.
Thu May 12 17:48:40 +0000 2016 .@RepJohnConyers &amp; I, &amp; 100+ Congress members, sent a letter to Fed Chair Yellen about the Fed’s diversity problem: https://t.co/lRHP7Fw4Kp
Thu May 12 17:46:39 +0000 2016 I appreciate @RepJohnConyers' leadership on this letter, and his long record of leadership on civil rights and diversity issues.
Thu May 12 17:43:52 +0000 2016 A lack of diverse leadership is hurting the @FederalReserve’s policy decision-making process. https://t.co/LZO88IOfyN

Mon May 02 18:16:35 +0000 2016 .@USDOL proposed a strong new rule to close the overtime loophole &amp; ensure a hard day’s work is rewarded with a fair day’s pay. #overdueOT
Mon May 02 16:37:54 +0000 2016 Thank you @RepStephenLynch &amp; @SenMarkey for your leadership, &amp; Rolling Thunder for your hard work to get our POW/MIA bill passed &amp; signed.
Mon May 02 16:37:10 +0000 2016 I’m glad that @POTUS signed into law my bipartisan Ntl POW/MIA Remembrance Act to place a commemorative POW/MIA chair in the US Capitol.
Fri Apr 29 21:56:09 +0000 2016 Boston isn't waiting for Congress to step up &amp; make debt-free college a reality. Great work, @marty_walsh! https://t.co/jJX0jRaHbn

Thu Apr 28 21:32:57 +0000 2016 Now we have a real, genuine health crisis in America — the #Zika virus — and the @SenateGOP have done nothing but get ready for vacation.
Mon Apr 25 00:01:44 +0000 2016 I'm glad to join strong women like ones on our @ussoccer #USWNT to fight for equal pay - in offices, factories, &amp; yes, on the soccer field.

Thu Apr 07 22:08:14 +0000 2016 .@SenSherrodBrown &amp; I sent a letter to @USTreasury urging a #PanamaPapers investigation: https://t.co/DKo796jJZF https://t.co/rlSYptnfE3
Wed Apr 06 17:33:31 +0000 2016 It’s thanks to @POTUS &amp; @LaborSec – who both fought for working families – that we have this strong rule today. #SaveYourSavings
Wed Apr 06 17:28:41 +0000 2016 .@CoryBooker And count dollars, not just pennies. Find ways to save on big-ticket budget items like rent &amp; transportation. #SaveYourSavings
Wed Apr 06 16:57:12 +0000 2016 Glad to be here w/ @LaborSec &amp; @CoryBooker to talk about @USDOL’s new conflict of interest rule! #SaveYourSavings https://t.co/2vkIzKYk6Y

Wed Apr 06 00:10:53 +0000 2016 Glad to have Ed Kelly &amp; @THE_PFFM stop by our DC office. Our firefighters have our backs - &amp; we need to have theirs. https://t.co/RaXVy2ryAc
Tue Apr 05 17:37:48 +0000 2016 .@BankingGOP held a hearing today to talk about why we should roll back rules on mortgages &amp; credit cards because they’re just too costly.
Wed Mar 30 15:54:57 +0000 2016 I’ve laid out 5 simple reform fundamentals for @usedgov’s student loan program to clean up its act. #studentdebt https://t.co/3RAZJRlLCQ
Wed Mar 30 15:53:30 +0000 2016 It’s past time for @usedgov’s bank to start running the student loan program to benefit students, not companies like Navient. #studentdebt
Wed Mar 30 15:53:09 +0000 2016 Instead of holding Navient accountable, @usedgov’s student loan bank covered for them. Outrageous, but not surprising. #studentdebt
Fri Mar 25 16:15:13 +0000 2016 #ff to my friend @SenFranken, who has a brand-new office Twitter account. He's good enough, smart enough, &amp; doggone it, people like him.
Wed Mar 16 17:47:03 +0000 2016 .@POTUS has done his job selecting a nominee &amp; sending that nominee to the Senate. It’s time for the Senate to do its job. #SCOTUSnominee
Tue Mar 15 18:29:54 +0000 2016 I joined colleagues &amp; Hamilton's @Lin_Manuel to urge action so #PuertoRico can restructure its debt. #PRDayofAction https://t.co/czvfYet8ZL
Mon Mar 14 23:08:13 +0000 2016 It is my strong hope @JohnKingatED will make fixing these problems a top priority from his 1st day on the job until his last day on the job.
Mon Mar 14 23:07:45 +0000 2016 Watch my new floor speech about @JohnKingatED’s nomination &amp; the state of @usedgov: https://t.co/QUqCCiPa1g
Mon Mar 14 23:06:49 +0000 2016 .@JohnKingatED didn’t create these problems at @usedgov – but he has a lot of work to do to get the Dept’s higher ed house in order.
Mon Mar 14 23:06:21 +0000 2016 Secretary of Ed is one of the toughest jobs, because for yrs @usedgov has put student loan companies &amp; for-profit colleges before students.
Mon Mar 14 23:05:53 +0000 2016 The Senate just voted to confirm @JohnKingatED to be the next Secretary of Education – one of the most important jobs in DC.
Fri Mar 11 22:59:07 +0000 2016 Now the @CFTC should act to protect consumers by quickly finalizing the Dodd-Frank-required position limits rule.
Fri Mar 11 22:58:49 +0000 2016 .@CFTC Commissioner Giancarlo made the right decision to withdraw this flawed report.
Fri Mar 11 22:58:14 +0000 2016 Today, the @CFTC withdrew the advisory committee’s report: https://t.co/UIS5uEIsTv
Fri Mar 11 22:57:46 +0000 2016 Two weeks ago, I tweeted about a @CFTC advisory committee report written by industry insiders. https://t.co/gRQyLO6X3U
Thu Mar 10 00:09:00 +0000 2016 .@ElizabethBanks isn't from District 12 or the Capitol, she's from Pittsfield! Great to see her (&amp; @Americans4Arts). https://t.co/XRbS5k1AC5
Wed Mar 09 21:53:27 +0000 2016 Today groups delivered 800k petition signatures to @SenateMajLdr’s office - urging a vote on the #SAVEBenefits Act. https://t.co/F19uymKJhA
Wed Mar 09 21:27:21 +0000 2016 Watch my new floor speech telling the @Senate_GOPs: #doyourjob &amp; consider a SCOTUS nominee: https://t.co/UdPOJ8bayc
Wed Mar 09 21:26:44 +0000 2016 The game's over. If @Senate_GOPs want to stand up to extremist candidates, they can start by standing up to extremists in the Senate.
Wed Mar 09 21:26:11 +0000 2016 .@Senate_GOPs want to play it both ways: rejecting @POTUS’s legitimacy and crippling the govt while claiming Rs can govern responsibly.
Wed Mar 09 21:25:47 +0000 2016 At the same time they’re blocking any SCOTUS nominee, @Senate_GOPs are in a panic that their party will nominate an extremist for President.
Tue Mar 08 23:01:13 +0000 2016 Glad to intro @RepJoeKennedy's bill in the Sen to strengthen accountability &amp; give consumers better tools for info.  https://t.co/oIYolosPr9
Mon Mar 07 17:13:35 +0000 2016 Read my new @TalkPoverty op-ed on why we need the #SAVEBenefits Act to give seniors &amp; vets a SS raise: https://t.co/TZsHxz9LiQ
Fri Mar 04 20:04:36 +0000 2016 The @CFPB should move soon &amp; robustly on its new rules for payday lenders. No delays, and no carve-outs.
Fri Mar 04 20:04:09 +0000 2016 The @CFPB is doing a great job to crack down on the tricks &amp; traps in payday loans. Congress should back the @CFPB, not sabotage it.
Fri Mar 04 20:03:42 +0000 2016 Until the @CFPB, no federal agency was responsible for overseeing payday lenders, who can stick vulnerable people with rates up to 400%.
Mon Feb 29 16:37:09 +0000 2016 FMLA was a huge step fwd, and we must do more. Read my @BostonGlobe op-ed on how to level the playing field: https://t.co/uRk48gJvkM
Thu Feb 25 21:23:05 +0000 2016 Read my letter to @CTFC Commissioner Giancarlo, calling on him to withdraw this report: https://t.co/naYfAuGNBZ
Thu Feb 25 21:22:32 +0000 2016 The @CFTC committee’s report is little more than a recitation of industry talking points and should be treated as such.
Thu Feb 25 21:22:10 +0000 2016 The @CFTC report is riddled w/ problems &amp; mischaracterizations, &amp; adopted without public discussion or public vote.
Thu Feb 25 21:21:25 +0000 2016 The advisory committee behind this compromised @CFTC report consists almost entire of industry insiders – violating Dodd-Frank.
Thu Feb 25 21:21:04 +0000 2016 Today that advisory committee presented a final report that is critical of the @CFTC’s proposed rule on commodities futures &amp; swaps.
Thu Feb 25 21:20:41 +0000 2016 Under Dodd-Frank, Congress directed the @CFTC to establish the EEMAC – an advisory committee for diverse views on CFTC actions.
Thu Feb 25 19:34:16 +0000 2016 Today I joined the @SenateDems at the Supreme Court to tell the GOP: #DoYourJob on a #SCOTUS nominee. https://t.co/hVjX9KfnYj
Mon Feb 22 21:54:49 +0000 2016 Wishing my very best for a speedy recovery to one of the Senate’s toughest fighters, @clairecmc. The whole Twitterverse is here for you!
Sun Feb 14 14:44:16 +0000 2016 .@SenateMajLdr is right that Americans should have a voice in selecting the next SCOTUS justice. In fact, they did: when @POTUS won in 2012.
Thu Feb 11 19:44:06 +0000 2016 .@RepCummings &amp; I sent a letter to @USDOL about advisors’ wildly conflicting messages on a conflict of interest rule https://t.co/U7y9ZoFrxi
Tue Feb 09 19:53:59 +0000 2016 I won't support more "innovation" proposals until we have a bipartisan agreement to strengthen @US_FDA &amp; seriously fund medical research.
Tue Feb 09 19:53:01 +0000 2016 Last yr, @newtgingrich said ignoring this NIH funding problem “takes a special kind of stupidity that is reserved for this city.” I agree.
Fri Jan 29 15:43:44 +0000 2016 Read my new @nytimes op-ed about how personnel is policy for enforcing federal laws: https://t.co/BZZSpjm7VS
Thu Jan 28 01:46:11 +0000 2016 I don’t love Wall St bankers who break our economy – but I LOVED #TheBigShort. Great to meet @GhostPanther today! https://t.co/l8cNe1gZ17

Tue Jan 12 22:48:20 +0000 2016 .@POTUS &amp; the @SenateDems are fighting for students &amp; families #InTheRed. It’s long past time for the GOP leadership to join us.
Tue Jan 12 22:47:06 +0000 2016 I’d like for you to meet my #SOTU guest: Alexis, a 1st generation college student at @UMassLowell. #InTheRed https://t.co/AkbYQhcUI7

Tue Jan 05 02:05:27 +0000 2016 I strongly support @POTUS’s action to #stopgunviolence. If Congress won’t step up to keep our kids safe, somebody else needs to start.
Wed Dec 09 18:52:44 +0000 2015 .@DrLeanaWen trained me in the use of Naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal drug than can save lives. https://t.co/4FbWAwZEEQ
Tue Dec 08 21:41:18 +0000 2015 The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis. We need smart ideas to solve it, like @GloucesterPD’s work to treat addiction w/o arrests.
Thu Dec 03 20:05:28 +0000 2015 .@RepCummings &amp; I are hosting a forum on #childpoverty w/ @sr_simone,  @KathrynEdin, &amp; @GreensteinCBPP now. Watch: https://t.co/J4JrdiJ1Mn

Mon Nov 02 22:58:46 +0000 2015 I support the @WhiteHouse’s executive order to #BanTheBox on federal job apps. A criminal record shouldn’t mean a life sentence of poverty.

Wed Oct 21 22:08:29 +0000 2015 .@PRyan Family time should not be a privilege reserved for the Speaker of the House. You deserve it – and so does everyone else.
Wed Oct 21 22:07:57 +0000 2015 .@PRyan That's why Dems are fighting for paid sick time, family leave &amp; schedules that work - bills your party repeatedly blocks.
Wed Oct 21 22:07:37 +0000 2015 Millions of hard-working moms &amp; dads want work/life balance too @PRyan - but can be fired just asking for time off to care for a sick kid.
Wed Oct 21 22:07:15 +0000 2015 I'm glad to see @PRyan understands the importance of work/life balance for his next job.
Tue Oct 20 23:17:05 +0000 2015 The GOP knows the way to undermine the @CFPB is to make it a commission. I’m not buying it. Dems shouldn't either. https://t.co/rgo6eFu2xh

Mon Aug 03 22:38:38 +0000 2015 The GOP plan to defund @PPFA is a right-wing attack on women’s rights. Watch why I voted to #StandwithPP: https://t.co/QdJD6dlTum
Mon Aug 03 20:27:04 +0000 2015 "The GOP plan to defund @PPFA is a GOP plan to defund women’s health care. I #standwithPP – and I hope my colleagues will do the same."
Mon Aug 03 20:26:08 +0000 2015 "A vote to defund @PPFA is a vote to defund cancer screenings &amp; birth control &amp; basic health care for millions of women." #StandwithPP
Mon Aug 03 20:25:22 +0000 2015 "To be clear: Even though the abortions performed at @PPFA are safe &amp; legal, the federal gov isn't paying for them." http://t.co/8KthIa9PnB

Mon Aug 03 20:22:55 +0000 2015 “The GOP vote to defund @PPFA is 1 more piece of a deliberate, methodical, orchestrated right-wing attack on women’s rights.” #StandwithPP
Mon Aug 03 20:22:39 +0000 2015 “Let’s be really clear: The GOP’s scheme to defund @PPFA is not some sort of surprised response to a highly edited video.” #StandwithPP
