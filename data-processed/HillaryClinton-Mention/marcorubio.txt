Sat May 14 16:26:04 +0000 2016 Invited @TodayShow b/c told us they would focus on terrible living conditions at HUD projects like this.They turned into political piece.

Sat May 14 16:22:40 +0000 2016 @TODAYshow could have done a real service doing story about abuses in public housing and HUD. Instead focus on political speculation
Sat May 14 16:21:15 +0000 2016 @TodaysHow didn't focus on the real story here, HUD projects runs by slumlords who pocket money but do no maintenance. #EurekaGardens
