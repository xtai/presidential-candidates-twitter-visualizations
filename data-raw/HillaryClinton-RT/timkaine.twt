Wed May 18 16:00:04 +0000 2016 The obligation for communities to affirmatively further #FairHousing is not new. RT if you stand against attempts to weaken the AFFH rule
Wed May 18 15:59:21 +0000 2016 It is fiction to say AFFH mandates changes to zoning laws, requires people to move, or ends local control of community planning #FairHousing
Wed May 18 15:58:54 +0000 2016 AFFH lets communities make informed planning &amp; investment decisions that break down barriers that stand in the way of #FairHousing choice
Wed May 18 15:58:27 +0000 2016 AFFH rule is at the core of #FairHousing Act. It's about expanding opportunity, investing in communities, and giving people choice
Wed May 18 15:55:57 +0000 2016 Affirmatively Furthering #FairHousing (AFFH) rule protects people from housing discrimination, providing justice and equality for all

Tue May 17 18:24:54 +0000 2016 Senate did its job by considering &amp; confirming a #SCOTUS nominee to ensure Brown v. Board had 9 justices to rule on this important matter
