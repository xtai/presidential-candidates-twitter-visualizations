Sun Jun 26 08:05:27 +0000 2016 #DemPlatform has progressive principles &amp; high standards on trade; reflects fact many Dems believe TPP doesn’t meet bar—HRC is one of them.
Sun Jun 26 06:45:27 +0000 2016 #DemPlatform calls for expanding Social Security, childless EITC &amp; surtax on multi-millionaires so those at the top pay their fair share.
Sun Jun 26 05:30:11 +0000 2016 #DemPlatform moves far beyond ‘all-of-the-above’ energy strategy, to a robust commitment to combating climate change with ambitious goals.
Sun Jun 26 04:35:35 +0000 2016 For the first time, #DemPlatform explicitly calls for repealing the Hyde Amendment, which restricts women’s access to reproductive rights.
Sun Jun 26 04:20:19 +0000 2016 Another highlight: #DemPlatform recognizes need to end sub-minimum wage for tipped workers &amp; people w/ disabilities &amp; create one fair wage.
Sun Jun 26 04:08:30 +0000 2016 #DemPlatform says Americans should earn at least $15 an hour, citing NY’s min wage law &amp; calling for raising &amp; indexing federal min wage.
Sun Jun 26 03:50:09 +0000 2016 For the first time ever, #DemPlatform calls for ending mass incarceration and the school-to-prison pipeline, and tackling systemic racism.
Sun Jun 26 03:28:36 +0000 2016 #DemPlatform reflects issues Hillary champions, like raising wages, immigration &amp; criminal justice reform &amp; protecting reproductive rights.

Mon Oct 05 17:02:41 +0000 2015 (5/5) Hillary's plan would close "Charleston Loophole" &amp; allow sufficient time &amp; resources to finish a background check b4 sale is approved.
Mon Oct 05 16:57:31 +0000 2015 (4/5) And it's not just Charleston. This loophole allowed more than 2,500 gun purchases that should have been prohibited to happen in 2014.
Mon Oct 05 16:56:48 +0000 2015 (3/5) That's how the alleged Charleston shooter was able to purchase a gun, even with a criminal record, hence the name.
Mon Oct 05 16:55:43 +0000 2015 (2/5) Right now, if someone wants to buy a gun &amp; their background check is not complete within 3 days, the sale is allowed to happen anyway.
