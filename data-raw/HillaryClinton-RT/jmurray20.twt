Fri Jan 02 18:37:39 +0000 2015 @amandahess Good point. Bottom line tho, there are bad things to come out of this and good things, I think. Not mutually exclusive.
Fri Jan 02 18:35:29 +0000 2015 @amandahess guys chanting "no means no" obviously dont want to be next target of that ridicule.

Fri Jan 02 18:07:44 +0000 2015 @amandahess does the chant happening in the 1st place not point to success of public awareness campaigns of the issue?

Fri Jan 02 01:34:46 +0000 2015 Not to gloat, but did I say FSU would get their asses kicked in the 1st round of the CFP if they went undefeated in reg season? Yep, I did
Fri Jan 02 01:23:57 +0000 2015 @TommyK_5 haha! Didn't have to dig too deep to get to 2006-07 my friend!
Fri Jan 02 01:21:33 +0000 2015 @TommyK_5 oh but wait, what about 07 when you were .000 bc FSU had to cheat? Or 2006 when you were 2-6 bc they couldn't win the right way?
Fri Jan 02 01:19:16 +0000 2015 @TommyK_5 yep, that was a horrible year, no doubt.
Fri Jan 02 01:16:35 +0000 2015 @TommyK_5 2009 wasn't near .500?  7-6 seems awful close to .500 to me. And much more recent than 49 years.
Fri Jan 02 01:13:17 +0000 2015 @TommyK_5 I was pointing out that we had two in three years.  Unless Braxton Miller transfers, good luck matching that.
Fri Jan 02 01:11:26 +0000 2015 @TommyK_5 in 5 years when we're playing for the NC and you all are .500, you'll be reminding me of your 2013 championship and playoff run
Fri Jan 02 01:10:07 +0000 2015 @TommyK_5 That was 2 national championships in 3 years. Perhaps FSU can match that? Probs not though. But I can tell you this...
