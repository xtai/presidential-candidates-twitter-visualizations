Thu Oct 01 01:26:45 +0000 2015 13. Meanwhile, @hillaryclinton will continue to fight for the issues that really matter to Americans. Let's hope Republicans follow.
Thu Oct 01 01:24:37 +0000 2015 12. This is a remarkable new low for a party that has made obstruction its strategy for years.Time for them to get back to their real jobs.
Thu Oct 01 01:21:42 +0000 2015 11. The Zadroga Bill's authorization will lapse tonight. It provides health coverage to 9/11 first responders. The GOP has done nothing.
Thu Oct 01 01:18:02 +0000 2015 10. But while the GOP focuses their time on fighting against womens health providers, or HRC's poll #'s, they're avoiding real issues.
Thu Oct 01 01:15:15 +0000 2015 9. This is right from their playbook. The GOP just announced a new committee to investigate @PPact, with an equally ambiguous end-goal.
Thu Oct 01 01:11:53 +0000 2015 8. @HouseBenghazi has cost the taxpayers over $4.5 million, and is the eighth congressional investigation into the same topic.
Thu Oct 01 01:09:41 +0000 2015 7. As of this week, @HouseBenghazi is the longest congressional investigation ever. Longer than Watergate or Pearl Harbor.
Thu Oct 01 01:07:39 +0000 2015 6. The committee set up to look into the deaths of four brave Americans is nothing more than a taxpayer-funded sham. Think about that.
Thu Oct 01 01:06:38 +0000 2015 5. This confirms exactly what we've been saying all along. But to hear it from him it exposes something far more cynical.
Thu Oct 01 01:04:21 +0000 2015 4. @GOPLeader: ‚ÄúWe put together a Benghazi select committee...What are her numbers today?" They measure "accomplishment" by how HRC polls.
Thu Oct 01 01:02:38 +0000 2015 3. He was asked to name an accomplishment under the GOP congress. What he said was a damning show of candor.
Thu Oct 01 01:01:17 +0000 2015 2. The Select Committee to Investigate Benghazi is simply a partisan hit job against Hillary Clinton--and that's according to @GOPLeader.
Thu Oct 01 00:59:45 +0000 2015 1. Last night, @GOPLeader, the GOP speaker-in-waiting, surprised us with his honesty.
