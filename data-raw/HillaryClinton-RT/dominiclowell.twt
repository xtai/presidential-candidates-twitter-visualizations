Thu Aug 11 17:41:49 +0000 2016 This November, the choice could not be more clear. We must stand up, say #LoveTrumpsHate, and elect @hillaryclinton.
Thu Aug 11 17:41:41 +0000 2016 By endorsing these views, Donald Trump has once again shown that he stands opposed to LGBT people and our rights.
Thu Aug 11 17:41:33 +0000 2016 There is no doubt this is a gathering of anti-LGBT leaders who are advancing hate speech and policies that are harmful to LGBT folks.
Thu Aug 11 17:41:24 +0000 2016 One pastor has commented that he believes LGBT people cannot build happy families because they are ‚Äúdepressed.‚Äù
Thu Aug 11 17:41:12 +0000 2016 One anti-LGBT speaker has gone so far as to say he thinks God is preventing a cure to HIV and AIDS as a penalty for homosexuality.
Thu Aug 11 17:41:00 +0000 2016 Another leader has described the Orlando memorials set up to honor the 49 people who lost their lives as ‚Äúhomosexual love fests‚Äù
Thu Aug 11 17:40:52 +0000 2016 One conference organizer describes our fight for equality as ‚Äúhomosexual totalitarianism‚Äù and refers to our movement‚Äôs heroes as ‚Äúmilitants‚Äù

Thu Aug 11 17:40:28 +0000 2016 Today Trump joins a who‚Äôs who of the anti-LGBT movement ‚Äî folks who don‚Äôt believe we are equal and are intent on ‚Äúchanging‚Äù us.
Thu Aug 11 17:40:17 +0000 2016 This is why many in the community reacted so strongly when he claimed to be a friend to the LGBT community ‚Äî we knew he wasn‚Äôt.
Thu Aug 11 17:40:04 +0000 2016 It‚Äôs disgraceful that Trump is speaking at an anti-LGBT gathering in Orlando just two months after the horrific tragedy at Pulse.
