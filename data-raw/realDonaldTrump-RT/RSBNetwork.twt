Wed Apr 20 03:17:46 +0000 2016 Cruz National spokesman @RonNehring just made voters dislike LYIN' Ted even more after being a complete jerk on @megynkelly.
Wed Apr 20 03:16:03 +0000 2016 Cruz's national spokesman @RonNehring is being an absolute jerk on @megynkelly now, turning off lots of voters. Looks like an unhappy guy.

Sun Apr 17 20:24:16 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT I respect your opinion, don't get me wrong.
Sun Apr 17 20:24:03 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT It's about promoting what we believe is right for our country at this time. We wanna be on the RIGHT SIDE of history.
Sun Apr 17 20:23:11 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT That's your opinion, and I respect it.
Sun Apr 17 20:22:56 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT And that's OK with us.
Sun Apr 17 20:22:42 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT Make no mistake, we are for Trump. There are nine of us, and we're all for Trump- one was for Cruz but not anymore.
Sun Apr 17 20:21:55 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT There ain't no fairness doctrine here. We don't have to give equal time to anyone.
Sun Apr 17 20:21:23 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT  Why should we have to disclose something only to avoid the appearance of being biased? People can either watch or not.
Sun Apr 17 20:18:51 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT Go look at our website and find Ted Cruz speeches. They are there- but there are no views.
Sun Apr 17 20:18:27 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT I really don't see any need to disclose that. No one assumes we are funded by Trump...cause we aren't.
Sun Apr 17 20:15:11 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT We are very small, a startup. We don't have the resources to cover multiple candidates- even if we did, low ratings!
Sun Apr 17 20:14:29 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT  DONATIONS and advertising revenue. That's it.. Trump may send views our way, but not in any way funded by the campaign.
Sun Apr 17 20:10:57 +0000 2016 All media are biased. The difference is we actually tell you who we're for and don't pretend to be impartial. How refreshing- honesty!
Sun Apr 17 20:09:43 +0000 2016 @GINGER_CONSULT Not paid by Trump. All media are biased. The difference is we actually tell u who we're for &amp; don't pretend to be impartial.
Sun Apr 17 19:45:00 +0000 2016 Why would we cover a candidate who has no chance to win? https://t.co/ihLhddy3mM

Sat Mar 05 21:59:20 +0000 2016 NO way Cruz wins Maine or Louisiana. And probably not Kentucky. If he does, I call BS. Sometimes polls are wrong, but not THAT wrong.
