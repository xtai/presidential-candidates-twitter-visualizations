Sun Jul 31 20:28:21 +0000 2016 Donald Trump's entire interview with @GStephanopoulos was breathtaking even by Trump standards. Trump &amp; Clinton. Wow. What a year.
Sun Jul 31 20:16:53 +0000 2016 Hillary Clinton still denying that she sent or received classified information today was breathtaking even by Clinton standards.

Fri Jul 29 01:48:38 +0000 2016 At the very least, tonight is triangulation on a massive scale.  #DemsinPhilly
Fri Jul 29 01:46:29 +0000 2016 Craig Shirley told me this morning that America's political parties may be undergoing a fundamental shift. Tonight could prove him right.
Fri Jul 29 01:33:14 +0000 2016 Marine generals, evangelical preachers, Reagan staffers, police officers. The final night of the DNC has been politically vertiginous.
Fri Jul 29 01:30:13 +0000 2016 Oh my God.  #DemsInPhilly
Fri Jul 29 01:28:44 +0000 2016 The transformation of America's political parties seems to be unfolding before our eyes. How will Republican leaders respond?
Fri Jul 29 01:26:58 +0000 2016 The Democratic Convention is chanting "USA! USA! USA!" while a general declares "We are the greatest nation on the planet."  #DemsInPhilly
Fri Jul 29 01:20:19 +0000 2016 The Democratic Convention broke out into chants of USA during one of the most moving convention speeches I've ever seen.  #DemsInPhilly
Fri Jul 29 01:17:37 +0000 2016 "Have you ever read the United States Constitution? I will be glad to let you read mine."  #DemsInPhilly
Fri Jul 29 01:15:06 +0000 2016 "We are proud to stand here as proud American Muslims with undivided loyalty to this country." #EPluribusUnum  #DemsInPhilly
Fri Jul 29 01:06:24 +0000 2016 Small government conservatives deserve leaders who believe in the greatness of America and know our Republic's greatest days are ahead.
Fri Jul 29 00:54:57 +0000 2016 Democrats used to be easy to best because they were always so down on America. In 2016, the nattering nabobs of negativism are Trump's GOP.
Fri Jul 29 00:51:43 +0000 2016 The Democrats have spent this hour praising Ronald Reagan and saluting our fallen police officers. It is moving and so positive.
Thu Jul 28 21:37:37 +0000 2016 DJT, do yourself a favor.  Denounce Putin's invasion of Crimea. Denounce his killing of journalists. Denounce his hacking of the DNC.

Thu Jul 28 18:46:55 +0000 2016 I've never felt more strongly that America's best days lie ahead. With faith &amp; courage we can perform great deeds &amp; take freedom's next step
Thu Jul 28 18:44:11 +0000 2016 "How can we not believe in the greatness of America? We will not turn back. We will finish our job. How could we do less? We're Americans."
Thu Jul 28 18:37:44 +0000 2016 The Reagan coalition is not falling apart. It has already collapsed. False profits of doom have been distorting Reagan's message for years.
Thu Jul 28 18:20:15 +0000 2016 Democrats embrace God, optimism &amp; American exceptionalism at the DNC. Trump embraces Putin, isolationism &amp; doesn't mention God at the RNC.

Thu Jul 28 00:40:11 +0000 2016 Trump's ploy of peddling outrageous statements keeps working. Tonight his encouragement of Russian hackers is dominating news websites.
Thu Jul 28 00:23:53 +0000 2016 Why is the DNC focused on guns? Because 90% of Americans oppose the Republican Party's position on background checks.  #DemsInPhilly
Thu Jul 28 00:18:58 +0000 2016 "Standing up to the gun lobby" is now defined as simply supporting stronger background checks for terrorists and domestic abusers.

Mon Dec 07 01:23:48 +0000 2015 The president delivered absolutely no new policy approaches despite the fact an overwhelming number of Americans disagree with his approach.
Mon Dec 07 01:21:33 +0000 2015 God. Is this guy really going to be responsible for our fight against ISIS for the next year? Political platitudes replace military strategy
Mon Dec 07 01:18:29 +0000 2015 A lifelong Democrat who has never voted for a Republican said, "I'm baffled. He still doesn't get it."
Mon Dec 07 01:15:14 +0000 2015 Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Mon Dec 07 01:14:57 +0000 2015 Even if I agree with him on tougher background checks and tougher Visa screenings, those are pathetically inadequate approaches for ISIS.
Mon Dec 07 01:13:28 +0000 2015 The president delivers his most important foreign policy speech and lists gun control, visa policies and respect as the way to best ISIS???
