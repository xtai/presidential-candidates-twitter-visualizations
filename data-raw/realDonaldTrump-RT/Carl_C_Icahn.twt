Fri Feb 07 20:08:04 +0000 2014 @jimcramer @ScottWapnerCNBC No need to call Scott. As you noted this morning, Tim came in Clint Eastwood-style and has a lot more bullets.
Fri Feb 07 20:07:47 +0000 2014 RT @jimcramer: @Carl_C_Icahn -Time to call in to @ScottWapnerCNBC about how much you've been buying of late? Stock has big bid underneath
Fri Feb 07 19:17:38 +0000 2014 $GOOG @ 19x2014 est operating profit. At same multiple $AAPL=$1,245 per share. Ridiculous. Keep buying Tim! You still have $145 billion cash
Fri Feb 07 19:17:16 +0000 2014 Tim Cook again confirms $AAPL will launch new products in new categories (plural) this year. Wall Street apparently still not listening.
Thu Jan 30 14:30:02 +0000 2014 Cynical @barronsonline piece on $DELL-“Dell's Prospects Suddenly Brighten.” Which Dell was tellng truth when shrhldrs sold @ bargain price?

Tue Jan 28 16:04:16 +0000 2014 Just bought $500 mln more $AAPL shares. My buying seems to be going neck-and-neck with Apple's buyback program, but hope they win that race.
Thu Jan 23 20:13:12 +0000 2014 Today we have put out a seven page letter to $AAPL shareholders discussing why buyback should be markedly increased: http://t.co/O7F8S7BzWg
Thu Jan 23 20:08:23 +0000 2014 Bought another $500mil of $AAPL tday, bringing our total to $3.6 billion.  If board doesn’t see AAPL’s ‘no brainer’ value we sure do.
Thu Jan 23 19:26:51 +0000 2014 I'll be speaking with @CGasparino today at 3:10.
Wed Jan 22 15:40:12 +0000 2014 We feel $APPL board is doing great disservice to shareholders by not having markedly increased its buyback. In-depth letter to follow soon.
Wed Jan 22 15:39:49 +0000 2014 Having purchased $500 million more $AAPL shares in the last two weeks, our investment has crossed the $3 billion mark yesterday.
Wed Jan 22 15:39:30 +0000 2014 Since tweeting about our large position in $AAPL on Aug 13, when the stock was 468 per share, we’ve kept buying shares of this ‘no brainer.’
Wed Jan 08 18:59:22 +0000 2014 Oops. Had a typo –$FRX up approx 18% today not 8%

Wed Jan 08 18:30:50 +0000 2014 Activism proves to be working well at $FRX. Since Sept 10 (when new CEO Brent Saunders arrived) the co’s stock is up aprx 57% and 8% today.

Mon Sep 09 13:02:27 +0000 2013 We intend to release a letter to all Dell shareholders shortly.
Tue Aug 27 13:59:48 +0000 2013 Our reply: IEP fund is up 19.03% since July 1. While we like the NY Post, what you read in the papers, “ain’t necessarily so.”
Tue Aug 27 13:59:30 +0000 2013 Sunday’s NY Post article, ‘Radioactivists,’ in its 1st sentence states: “This summer, Wall Street’s activist top guns are shooting blanks…”
Thu Aug 22 18:34:59 +0000 2013 Spoke to Tim. Planning dinner in September. Tim believes in buyback and is doing one. What will be discussed is magnitude.
Thu Aug 15 16:41:09 +0000 2013 NYT's thesis that Ackman's actions prove something is wrong with activism is specious. His actions prove only something is wrong with Ackman
Tue Aug 13 18:25:09 +0000 2013 Had a nice conversation with Tim Cook today. Discussed my opinion that a larger buyback should be done now. We plan to speak again shortly.

Fri Aug 02 15:23:55 +0000 2013 We are pleased to have won another battle in the Dell war but the war itself is far from over. More to follow.
Mon Jul 29 18:41:53 +0000 2013 Of all his scare tactics Dell has finally come up with the best one-he’ll stay as CEO if we don’t accept his offer. http://t.co/cpmcnXfOHy
Mon Jul 29 17:37:24 +0000 2013 Reply to MD's WSJ intv to come. I explain a reason Dell is undervalued is due to a major liability that can be easily removed-Michael Dell.
Wed Jul 24 15:12:04 +0000 2013 All would be swell at Dell if Michael and the board bid farewell.
Tue Jul 16 18:35:08 +0000 2013 I’ll be an Alpha Agitator at tmrw’s Delivering Alpha Conference. Nowadays there are plenty of corporate boards and CEOs to agitate about.
