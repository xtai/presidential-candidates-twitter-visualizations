Tue Dec 03 00:05:43 +0000 2013 If we are dishonest, we cannot hide it for long. Amazingly, most of us have an uncanny ability to detect dishonest people.
Mon Dec 02 21:35:18 +0000 2013 When we act dishonestly, we cheat ourselves.
Mon Dec 02 17:06:16 +0000 2013 If we consciously decide to be honest, decent, clean, and not put skeletons in our closets, then we can concentrate on what we are doing.
Mon Dec 02 15:34:46 +0000 2013 "The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be ignited" - Plutarch

Fri Nov 29 02:24:59 +0000 2013 I hope everyone has had a delightful Thanksgiving as this blessed day comes to a close. Make being thankful a habit and not a yearly ritual.
Thu Nov 28 01:35:23 +0000 2013 Sometimes giving our best and Thinking Big involves a great deal of risk.

Wed Nov 27 20:30:59 +0000 2013 When we act dishonestly, we must realize that it is only ourselves that we are cheating.
Mon Nov 25 17:12:01 +0000 2013 It doesn't matter where you're from. People who fail in life find lots of excuses. It's never too late to recognize the potential in oneself
Sun Nov 24 14:27:04 +0000 2013 If we commit ourselves to reading thus increasing our knowledge, only God limits how far we can go in this world.

Fri Nov 22 15:23:11 +0000 2013 It saddens me that influential people Oprah Winfrey would ever play the race card and deem those opposing the President's agenda as racist.
Thu Nov 21 23:10:19 +0000 2013 There is no such person as a self-made individual.
Thu Nov 21 15:02:56 +0000 2013 Yes, we need health care reform but it must not be imposed upon us by a government thinking it knows what is best for the American people.

Tue Nov 19 20:15:45 +0000 2013 The physically disabled possess gifts not readily apparent to everyone. We must treasure them in exerting compassion &amp; an utmost respect.
Tue Nov 19 17:06:52 +0000 2013 America surviving as a nation is dependent on being able to solve quadratic equations as opposed to the ability to sink a 25 ft jump shot.
Tue Nov 19 13:57:50 +0000 2013 One of the greatest harms to our health is repeated stress. Theres far less stress in honest lives than those filled with misdeeds and lies.
Tue Nov 19 00:15:25 +0000 2013 Detroit is but a harbinger of the fate that will befall our beloved nation if we don’t heed the warnings so vividly placed before us.
Mon Nov 18 20:05:24 +0000 2013 Having grown up in Detroit, I am particularly sad to see what has happened to a once-vibrant city that was the wealthiest in the nation.
Mon Nov 18 17:11:05 +0000 2013 Our current economy is toxic for growth. We must realize that our large federal debt will eventually spoil our future if we don’t act now.
Mon Nov 18 15:16:22 +0000 2013 …the brain can process two million bits of information per second. It remembers everything you've ever seen, everything you've ever heard…
Mon Nov 18 00:20:34 +0000 2013 Everyone in the world is worth being nice to. Because God never creates inferior human beings, each person deserves respect and dignity.
Sun Nov 17 20:45:45 +0000 2013 Knowledge strengthens one's power to overcome the past, to change our own situations, to fight new obstacles, &amp; to make better decisions.
Sun Nov 17 17:37:33 +0000 2013 Treating other people with kindness and love is my way of paying my debt to God and the world for the privilege of living on this planet.

Thu Nov 14 20:35:18 +0000 2013 Life is too short to make enemies of those disagreeing with you. We learn much more from those we disagree with than those we do agree with.

Thu Nov 14 17:07:27 +0000 2013 Marriage is a tremendous gift from God providing the security of a safe &amp; stable society to raise children; We must reclaim the honor in it.

Wed Nov 13 00:35:36 +0000 2013 The ACA is oxymoronic, the time must come when we are collectively concerned for each other rather than what is advantageous for each other.
Tue Nov 12 20:35:50 +0000 2013 In living truthfully theres no need to recall what was previously said. The truth is always the truth &amp; adhering to it simplifies your life.
Tue Nov 12 17:45:19 +0000 2013 Political bullying is no different than school yard bullying. You must stand your ground, don't back down, and watch as it withers on.
Tue Nov 12 15:37:50 +0000 2013 Most bullies dont look for fights but just want to intimidate people into submission. Refusing to yield &amp; fighting back rids being targeted.
Mon Nov 11 15:16:18 +0000 2013 Ultimately our freedom stems from God. However we must thank the Veterans that have battled to secure &amp; maintain the freedom which we enjoy.

Fri Nov 08 00:15:17 +0000 2013 Among the many factors involved in our success was the conscious creation of an atmosphere conducive to innovation and hard work.
Thu Nov 07 20:15:36 +0000 2013 Can we learn from the mistakes of nations that preceded us &amp; take corrective active, or must we follow the same self-destructive course?

Tue Nov 05 18:51:34 +0000 2013 Kindness dictates that we abandon the pettiness stimulated by pride. We must remember that there are no perfect people, including ourselves.
Tue Nov 05 16:16:08 +0000 2013 If you treat obstacles as a containing fence they become excuses for failure. Treat them as hurdles, each one strengthens you for the next.
Tue Nov 05 14:51:25 +0000 2013 Success is determined not by whether or not you face obstacles, but by your reaction to them.
Mon Nov 04 23:01:49 +0000 2013 Looking forward to speaking about truth in leadership at @AlabamaPolicy Annual Banquet this week. We must again value virtuous leadership.
Mon Nov 04 19:50:35 +0000 2013 Admitting one is wrong requires a great deal of humility. A genuine leader can admit fault &amp; has the ability to learn from their mistakes.
Mon Nov 04 16:15:58 +0000 2013 My Ravens losing to the Browns yesterday saddened me. We must keep our spirits high and know that our beloved Baltimore will persevere.

Fri Nov 01 18:35:48 +0000 2013 The Roman Empire was very, very much like us. They lost their moral core, their sense of values in terms of who they were.
Fri Nov 01 15:25:54 +0000 2013 People who spend every penny and borrow to spend even more have obviously never subscribed to the notion of saving for a rainy day.

Thu Oct 31 15:15:31 +0000 2013 We get out of life what we put into it. The way we treat others is the way we ourselves get treated.
Thu Oct 31 12:40:39 +0000 2013 Do your best and let God do the rest.
Wed Oct 30 23:05:35 +0000 2013 Rather than reacting to every risk we hear and see, we should make an effort to discern which ones we can actually do something about.
Wed Oct 30 21:05:13 +0000 2013 How are we to yield reasonable and wise decisions about the risks we face when our perspective on the subject is so often distorted?

Tue Oct 29 20:39:54 +0000 2013 In our culture, security has become an obsession. We buy every kind of insurance to provide us with the security we think we need.
Tue Oct 29 19:10:46 +0000 2013 If we recognize our talents and use them appropriately, and choose a field that uses those talents, we will rise to the top of our field.
Tue Oct 29 17:46:51 +0000 2013 Anyone who can't learn from other's mistakes simply can't learn, that's all there is to it. There is value in the wrong way of doing things.
