Sun Feb 28 00:19:38 +0000 2016 Not a surprise that Clinton would win SC but her overwhelming lead among African Americans is just astonishing.  84-16.  That's Obama-esque

Tue Feb 02 05:23:17 +0000 2016 The three campaigns whose results lived up to their spin even in the face of media skepticism: Cruz Rubio and Sanders.
Tue Feb 02 05:03:55 +0000 2016 Top Sanders grps: 17-29yo (84%) "Honest&amp;trustworthy" (83%) "more liberal policies (76%) income inequality (61%) 1st time attendee (59%)
Tue Feb 02 05:01:38 +0000 2016 Key Clinton grps: "Can win in Nov" (77%) 65+ (69%) "Cont Obama policies" (68%) Terrorism top issue (65%) Previous attendee (59%) Mod (58%)

Tue Feb 02 04:44:09 +0000 2016 Sanders may have made the mistake Santorum made in 2012, not seizing the mic sooner to declare "success".  Getting very late in the east
Tue Feb 02 04:35:26 +0000 2016 A "big sigh of relief" style of thank you to Iowa still means she stopped short of fully declaring victory

Tue Feb 02 04:18:14 +0000 2016 Key groups won by Rubio: college grads (27%) most worried about jobs (30%) can win in November (43%) Decided in the last few days  (29%)
Tue Feb 02 04:17:35 +0000 2016 Key groups won by Cruz: Previous attendees (31%) Very conserv (43%) Evangelical (33%) Terrorism top worry (33%) "Shares my values" (37%)
Tue Feb 02 04:08:45 +0000 2016 Wonder why Cruz is waiting so long to declare victory? Missed the east coast local news window (see NH and SC)

Tue Feb 02 04:03:15 +0000 2016 Wouldn't be surprised if there was a flood of endorsements for Rubio in the next week.
Tue Feb 02 03:59:41 +0000 2016 This may be the closest IA Dem caucus result since 1988 when to this day, Simon campaign vets believe they were robbed by Gephardt.
Tue Feb 02 03:56:27 +0000 2016 There is nothing in our models that backs up the Clinton campaign confidence that they won. They still might.  But it is thiCsLose
Tue Feb 02 03:53:22 +0000 2016 Trump didn't say a negative thing about a single GOPer tonight.  Notable
Tue Feb 02 03:52:49 +0000 2016 Iowa was must win for Cruz. NH is now must win for Trump.
Tue Feb 02 03:47:41 +0000 2016 Trump plans to take the stage after Rubio finishes.  Big test for him.  How does he handle losing.
Tue Feb 02 03:46:41 +0000 2016 Still, that's a lot of money Team Bush spent for what could be just one delegate in Iowa.
Tue Feb 02 03:46:17 +0000 2016 Our initial delegate allocation estimates for GOP indicate that even Bush might get one delegate based on IA allocation system.
Tue Feb 02 03:36:48 +0000 2016 Rubio campaign very savvy to claim the first "victory" speech slot of the night
Tue Feb 02 03:32:39 +0000 2016 How a candidate handles a concession speech on a night like this will tell us about their staying power.
Tue Feb 02 03:30:55 +0000 2016 Clinton source gloating: Sanders got turnout he needed and yet they believe she won.  Too close for us to call just yet.
Tue Feb 02 03:23:51 +0000 2016 Official. NBC has called it for Cruz.
Tue Feb 02 03:19:22 +0000 2016 We have 97% of GOP vote in. Cruz up 28-24 over Trump. But Rubio is just 2200 votes behind Trump and is at 23%
Tue Feb 02 03:18:17 +0000 2016 Only drama left on GOP side is whether Rubio catches Trump for second.  Now that's a surprise.
Tue Feb 02 03:16:18 +0000 2016 RT @ChemiShalev: Rubio is the new buzz, but 63% of GOP Iowans (right now) still voting for anti-establishment Cruz, Carson and Trump

Tue Feb 02 02:45:49 +0000 2016 @StuPolitics hopefully folks will realize. That they need 40 pound bags of salt with their results
Tue Feb 02 02:43:24 +0000 2016 On the Dem side, best news Clinton got was that Q poll showing Sanders ahead because if she wins then she survived. Win is a win
Tue Feb 02 02:42:15 +0000 2016 If this holds on GOP side, then Cruz shows he could take a punch. Rubio has the spark he needed and Trump now faces a must win in NH
Tue Feb 02 02:30:18 +0000 2016 My pollster pals will love this nugget: Cruz winning "very conservatives" Rubio winning "somewhat conservatives" Trump winning "moderates"
Tue Feb 02 02:14:23 +0000 2016 Rubio and Sanders won the late deciders according to entrance polls
Tue Feb 02 02:10:51 +0000 2016 Updated entrance poll indicates GOP electorate has gotten slightly more conservative.  Good news for Cruz
Tue Feb 02 01:11:00 +0000 2016 @Jamesthesnake the "very conservative" number is down 10 points from 2012
Tue Feb 02 01:10:02 +0000 2016 RT @NBCPolitics: As of 8pmET, @NBCNews characterizes Democratic and GOP Iowa caucuses as too early to call. #Decision2016 https://t.co/Ydpi…
Tue Feb 02 01:09:14 +0000 2016 Sanders wants a more liberal electorate and Trump needs a less conservative electorate. Both getting what they need. So far
Tue Feb 02 01:08:38 +0000 2016 Dem electorate is more than 10 points more liberal than 2008. The GOP electorate is nearly 10 points less on the "very conservative" front
Tue Feb 02 00:34:58 +0000 2016 Word of warning on entrance polls, they are useful for finding out who is showing up, first timers etc.  But the horse race is not bankable

Fri Jan 29 03:44:12 +0000 2016 But the more muddled this debate is, it ends up only helping one candidate... "the elephant not in the room."
Fri Jan 29 03:43:14 +0000 2016 Christie handled bridge Q very well, but the moderators haven't helped him engage with Rubio and Cruz as much as he needs to be right now
Fri Jan 29 03:42:06 +0000 2016 About 6 weeks ago, Rand Paul seemed to decide, time to go back to his Libertarian comfort zone. Found his voice again, but is there time?
Fri Jan 29 03:40:36 +0000 2016 Cruz took some incoming (less than I expected). Rubio had a strong start but immigration ties him in knots
Fri Jan 29 03:40:07 +0000 2016 This is a tough debate to declare a clear winner. Some candidates had great moments that won't play well w/GOP base, for instance, Jeb
Fri Jan 29 03:29:37 +0000 2016 Immigration may be THE decisive issue for many primary voters and yet tonight's debate muddled it for everyone, esp Cruz &amp; Rubio
Fri Jan 29 03:25:04 +0000 2016 There's a Google color coded state by state search map here in debate spin room.  And Trump is most searched in every state for this debate
Fri Jan 29 03:13:32 +0000 2016 Wow.  That was quite a montage Fox put together to ask Cruz that immigration question.   Will be curious if other candidates get montages
Fri Jan 29 02:45:45 +0000 2016 Disappointing that the Ferguson question was only directed to Paul. Too bad they didn't get a few others to weigh in
Fri Jan 29 02:38:43 +0000 2016 Meanwhile, Santorum is addressing Trump's crowd right now. What a surreal scene. What has this campaign come to?
Fri Jan 29 02:37:14 +0000 2016 Rubio continues to show the most comfort on stage when topic is national security.  He's been very strong for those looking for a hawk
Fri Jan 29 02:34:32 +0000 2016 "Hate action" -- For GOP primary voters, many will believe Rubio owned that domestic terrorism vs protected speech question.
Fri Jan 29 02:30:31 +0000 2016 Much tougher for Cruz to score points on media bashing when it is a Fox event.
Fri Jan 29 02:26:50 +0000 2016 With that last Christie hit, I believe there have now been more Hillary mentions than Trump mentions, just 26 mins into debate

Fri Jan 29 02:17:26 +0000 2016 Imagine if this Ben Carson had been this comfortable on stage when he was a frontrunner. He's truly improved at this format
Fri Jan 29 02:13:32 +0000 2016 Rubio's "i do respect Rand" comment seemed like a not so subtle shot at Cruz. Surprised he kept that so subtle
Fri Jan 29 02:12:22 +0000 2016 Well, who had Rand Paul in the "who will attack Ted Cruz first" pool?
Fri Jan 29 02:10:56 +0000 2016 It is two VERY different scenes at the Trump rally and the GOP debate.  There is a rock concert feel to the Trump event. Lower key at debate

Mon Jan 18 03:42:39 +0000 2016 As the debate turned to national security, you could see the focus shift from Sanders to Clinton.
Mon Jan 18 03:16:19 +0000 2016 Who's the frontrunner? If you only watched the debate and didn't read polls, you might assume Sanders
Mon Jan 18 02:56:44 +0000 2016 Clinton playing to room with her consistent answer structure that says things like "it builds" on what Obama did.  Wrapping herself in Obama
Mon Jan 18 02:52:59 +0000 2016 Sanders is punchy, he's taking little digs at Clinton at many turns including now on Wall Street issues
Mon Jan 18 02:46:05 +0000 2016 For better or worse, Sanders is dominating this portion of the debate.  He's pretty fired up.  Is it too hot for TV? #DemDebate.
Mon Jan 18 02:43:07 +0000 2016 Sanders call for "major reform" of Dem Party gets just a smattering of applause by a crowd made up of... Members of the Dem Party
Mon Jan 18 02:40:44 +0000 2016 @chrislhayes it's pretty even.  Sanders has had some loud cheers too. Even O'Malley
Mon Jan 18 02:37:40 +0000 2016 Clinton pushing the "health care fatigue" idea when questioning the Sanders proposal.  Swing voters might be but are progressives fatigued?
Mon Jan 18 02:34:19 +0000 2016 Clinton wrapping herself in Obama legacy when touting ObamaCare.  Popular with this audience.
Mon Jan 18 02:33:44 +0000 2016 Sanders showing some real energy and passion now on health care.
Mon Jan 18 02:16:56 +0000 2016 What makes the gun issue so problematic for Sanders is not just where Dem Party has moved but his defense sounds so, well, Washington
Mon Jan 18 02:14:18 +0000 2016 This debate could end up being more about Sanders than Clinton tonight.  A switch for the frontrunner.  #DemDebate

Sat Jan 16 21:30:37 +0000 2016 Clinton is running into the problem sitting VPs usually have when running for third terms. Hard to passionately fight for continuity

Fri Jan 15 02:36:06 +0000 2016 Rubio stole that moment from Trump-Cruz
Fri Jan 15 02:34:07 +0000 2016 Cruz helped by crowd.  But I'm not sure the Tribe attack is an effective pushback
Fri Jan 15 02:32:11 +0000 2016 Trump vp offer to Cruz is clever retort.

Wed Jan 13 02:26:03 +0000 2016 So far, it is a laundry list of issues, but a greatest hits of sort of items he pushed for in previous SOTUs
Wed Jan 13 02:20:57 +0000 2016 It took less than a minute for a friend/colleague to use POTUS "four big questions" and ask Why is this SOTU different from all others?
Wed Jan 13 02:19:38 +0000 2016 This line is rebuttal like for POTUS: "will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation?"
Wed Jan 13 02:18:45 +0000 2016 One way to look at this SOTU is that it is Pres Obama's rebuttal to the GOP Prez campaign to date.

Sat Jan 02 22:44:12 +0000 2016 @ChrisHarrison96 "nobody" is speaking. See the ratings
Sat Jan 02 22:40:23 +0000 2016 In fact, for the meaningless bowl games, you can use this year's tie ins to set the match ups for next August.  But these exhibitions stink
Sat Jan 02 22:36:50 +0000 2016 Then replace end of year meaningless bowls with beginning of the year "extra" games that are essentially bowl games. Sun Bowl can be in sept
Sat Jan 02 22:35:49 +0000 2016 Perhaps only way to save the bowls is to make the CFB post season all mean something -- expand post season and use current bowls.
Sat Jan 02 22:34:46 +0000 2016 Promise only one rant on this but this bowl season, from scheduling to match ups, couldn't be worse. About as compelling as NFL pro bowl
Sat Dec 26 22:51:55 +0000 2015 Glad to see Miami not quitting but some HORRENDOUS play calling and dumb mistakes. New coaching will help A LOT

Wed Dec 16 04:03:30 +0000 2015 Overall, there were too many candidates pressing tonight which at times detailed the debate esp in hour 2.
Wed Dec 16 04:02:26 +0000 2015 Jeb finally found his voice against Trump but was it too little too late?
Wed Dec 16 04:01:38 +0000 2015 Of non top tier, both Christie and Bush had good nights with Christie probably helping himself the most.  But he was a tad too hot at times
Wed Dec 16 04:00:41 +0000 2015 This was Rubio's toughest debate mostly because he didn't get glide by without taking incoming. Will his immigration stance stop his rise?
Wed Dec 16 03:59:29 +0000 2015 Trump and Cruz came into the night as the co-leaders and they leave in same place.  Both held up, prob cause they didn't hit each other

Wed Dec 16 03:33:47 +0000 2015 Rubio is getting a taste of what being a frontrunner feels like.  But his place in this race is VERY precarious. This pile on could hurt

Wed Dec 16 03:13:52 +0000 2015 There's a point where tough talk comes across as trying too hard.  There are a lot of candidates pressing tonight.
Wed Dec 16 03:08:48 +0000 2015 This has been one of Trump's better debate performances overall. He seems more comfortable and in control of his emotions

Wed Dec 16 02:46:55 +0000 2015 "I served on the Armed Services Committee for 18 years..." Is probably a line that never should be uttered in an anti-Washington year

Wed Dec 16 02:37:22 +0000 2015 Rubio's position on national security is more in line with GOP primary voters but Cruz defended himself quite effectively just now
Wed Dec 16 02:36:24 +0000 2015 Rubio v Cruz in a smaller debate setting would be quite the event.
Wed Dec 16 02:29:32 +0000 2015 Are the candidates hovering? These space age podiums are a tad distracting in the wide shots
Wed Dec 16 02:26:43 +0000 2015 RT @StuPolitics: Dr. Carson, you don't pass on a question, especially after you have complained that you are getting asked questions.
Wed Dec 16 02:25:59 +0000 2015 RT @reidepstein: Meanwhile, a half hour into the debate and the only shot at Trump was Jeb's "chaos candidate" line.
Wed Dec 16 02:24:29 +0000 2015 The non senators are enjoying beating up on the senators tonight.  Obvious hit given Cruz Rubio rise
Wed Dec 16 02:21:47 +0000 2015 He is? Why doesn't he ever mention that part of his background  https://t.co/9dUj6rVtSr
Wed Dec 16 02:20:52 +0000 2015 Christie has an "edge" to him tonight. On national security, should play well with primary voters but needs to be careful of looking too hot
Wed Dec 16 02:19:45 +0000 2015 Remember to watch debate thinking what will play well with a Maj of primary voters.  Betting Rubio got the best of that exchange w/voters
Wed Dec 16 02:16:41 +0000 2015 There are multiple levels of insulting a fellow Republican. Pedestrian attacks are "Obama-like".  A meaner version is to drop an "Alinsky"

Wed Nov 11 04:12:02 +0000 2015 As for Jeb, he seemed more comfortable than he has in the other three debates but was he impactful with voters?
Wed Nov 11 04:11:11 +0000 2015 Paul easily had his best debate night of campaign.  Cruz and Carly had good moments too. Rubio did no harm.  Kasich was (too?) aggressive.
Wed Nov 11 04:09:57 +0000 2015 Hard debate to say who was a clear winner.  The two frontrunners struggled more than rest of field but prob not enough to see poll fall
Wed Nov 11 04:07:44 +0000 2015 Climate change and min wage were topics at this debate.
Wed Nov 11 03:49:26 +0000 2015 Cruz is showing why so many insiders think he'll eventually be in the final two or three when the field winnows
Wed Nov 11 03:34:09 +0000 2015 This is the Paul on foreign policy that many thought would be a bigger player in primary. He hasn't been helped by Trump sharing his views
Wed Nov 11 03:29:46 +0000 2015 Both Jeb and Carly challenged Trump on Russia but Carly is owning her moment in a big way.

Wed Nov 11 03:27:14 +0000 2015 Trump's bragging about being on "60" w/Putin &amp;seeming like they cd be pals would be problematic for any other GOPer. Why isn't for him?
Wed Nov 11 03:23:32 +0000 2015 Jeb has done fine with the time he's had but again, there are large gaps between times he feels involved

Wed Nov 11 03:07:56 +0000 2015 Paul tosses a defense budget grenade on to the debate stage.

Wed Nov 11 02:26:05 +0000 2015 Wish some of these questions were asked of every candidate, including min wage q.
Wed Nov 11 02:25:49 +0000 2015 Good early questions being wasted because every candidate has tried too hard to get some stump lines in. Folo to Kasich got some specifics
Wed Nov 11 02:22:32 +0000 2015 Questions are solid.  Most candidates avoiding specifics though.
Wed Nov 11 02:10:20 +0000 2015 The two Republicans running who have publicly come out in favor of some raising of the min wage: Huckabee and Santorum.  Neither on stage
Wed Nov 11 01:16:13 +0000 2015 I think we know the answer for better debates. Four person debates are great.  Imagine three of them.  Rather than one 8 person.
Wed Nov 11 01:15:18 +0000 2015 Both Huckabee and Santorum bring a little economic issue diversity when it comes to the debate about wages and trade. Won't be on main stage
Wed Nov 11 01:12:33 +0000 2015 Not a single candidate on stage tonight has worn the uniform.  Only veteran running now is Graham. #NBC2016
Wed Nov 11 01:05:38 +0000 2015 Big charge by Christie to claim Fed isn't raising rates to protect POTUS.  Tough to prove. Perhaps good politics but produces cynicism.
Tue Nov 10 22:37:04 +0000 2015 #CarlyFiorina defends her lack of a detailed tax plan. I'll ask @MikeNeedham how that's playing with conservatives, next on #MTPDaily.

Wed Oct 14 02:57:04 +0000 2015 Not sure O'Malley did anything to change current trajectory of this race.  Can't easily see how he differentiates from Clinton or Sanders
Wed Oct 14 02:56:00 +0000 2015 Clinton showed most vulnerability on Wall Street regulation and the flip flop charges. Sanders showed vulnerability on guns &amp;foreign policy

Wed Oct 14 01:38:07 +0000 2015 This is why Webb ran for president, he wanted to push back at Clinton's foreign policy views. He's clearly comfortable w/the topic. #NBC2016
Wed Oct 14 01:36:41 +0000 2015 Clinton just reminded audience that Pres. Obama technically made the Libyan decision. Of course, Clinton was a BIG advocate
Wed Oct 14 01:35:13 +0000 2015 Sanders is just not comfortable talking about foreign policy. #NBC2016
Wed Oct 14 01:34:05 +0000 2015 Wonder if Sanders was slow on the response just now, wondering if he was supposed to respond to Webb and the South China Sea threat.

Wed Oct 14 01:17:57 +0000 2015 Now, O'Malley piles on Sanders for the gun manufacturing protection vote. Clinton happily nods. #NBC2016
Wed Oct 14 01:16:15 +0000 2015 Clinton didn't waste time reminding Dems she is to the left of Sanders on at least one issue. Betting Sanders is surprised by her aggression
Wed Oct 14 01:15:35 +0000 2015 Clinton campaign has to be pleased that the "capitalism" and guns issue are the opening issues. #NBC2016
Wed Oct 14 01:14:37 +0000 2015 So Twitter would like to know if everyone has gotten their third person jokes off their Twitter chests
Wed Oct 14 01:10:01 +0000 2015 Brutal way for O'Malley to introduce himself to the country, having to defend his record as mayor of Baltimore. #NBC2016
Wed Oct 14 01:09:25 +0000 2015 So Clinton both took a subtle jab at Sanders over his capitalism answer and then gave him a lifeline
Wed Oct 14 01:07:56 +0000 2015 Clinton's experience on national debate stage just showed itself again. She defined capitalism in a way that Sanders ended up agreeing with
Wed Oct 14 01:06:17 +0000 2015 Pretty tough Q from Cooper on the potential "attack ad" that GOP could write against Sanders. He avoided the specifics. #NBC2016
Wed Oct 14 01:04:32 +0000 2015 Clinton pivoted fairly well on the "progressive v moderate" Q though I'll be curious to hear how she would answer that Q if nominee #NBC2016
Wed Oct 14 01:03:18 +0000 2015 So this isn't a debate yet; It is a series of individuals. #NBC2016
Wed Oct 14 01:00:02 +0000 2015 You can tell Hillary Clinton has done this before; Easily the most poised on stage so far. #NBC2016
Wed Oct 14 00:57:54 +0000 2015 Sanders will want to watch how he plays on TV; there were times it felt like he was yelling. Great for rallies, not good for this stage
Wed Oct 14 00:56:35 +0000 2015 I like the 2 min. opening statements, especially for a FIRST debate. Gives you a decent condensed version of their stump speech. #NBC2016
Wed Oct 14 00:53:50 +0000 2015 Chafee Webb and O'Malley all have given opening statements designed to essentially say "I'm progressive too! Maybe more than THEM!"
Wed Oct 14 00:51:31 +0000 2015 Chafee talks "ethics," Webb starts with money in politics. #NBC2016

Sat Sep 19 23:50:37 +0000 2015 Only this iteration of the Miami program could make a win over Nebraska feel like a loss #GoCanes. Sorta relieved but fearing rest of season
Sat Sep 19 23:41:41 +0000 2015 Miami is making Andy Reid seem like a clock management genius #GoCanes
Sat Sep 19 23:39:39 +0000 2015 And now Golden is giving up? Are you serious? Speechless
Sat Sep 19 23:35:56 +0000 2015 Just a total debacle and it is on this coaching staff.  Pure and simple. Yes, some questionable officiating. But that's no excuse.
Sat Sep 19 23:29:49 +0000 2015 If Miami loses this game, there better be consequences.  Unacceptable #GoCanes
Sat Sep 19 23:26:55 +0000 2015 Only this current iteration of the Miami program could let happen what is happening right now.  FINISH! #GoCanes
Sat Sep 19 23:21:53 +0000 2015 Congrats officials, you gave Nebraska a chance. But it doesn't excuse Miami ONCE AGAIN having no 4thq Fire.
Sat Sep 19 23:17:54 +0000 2015 Not sure what is frustrating me more, the horrendous officiating or the sloppy way Miami is finishing.
Sat Sep 19 23:13:24 +0000 2015 These officials need to stop trying to will Nebraska back into this game. Started with the wrong call on the catch. #GoCanes
Sat Sep 19 23:12:15 +0000 2015 These officials have decided to have an agenda here.  Ridiculous calls now. #gocanes

Sat Sep 19 21:18:35 +0000 2015 Many of us fans have been tough on the D coaching. Let's give credit where it's due. Solid game plan today. #GoCanes
Sat Sep 19 21:15:37 +0000 2015 Big turnover for Miami. Makes up for the last two red zone hiccups.  #GoCanes This game could easily be 28-3 with better play calling
Sat Sep 19 20:56:21 +0000 2015 @NoPhotoOps predictable and stupid.
