Wed Jan 29 03:57:44 +0000 2014 SFC* not SCF. Apologies for the typo.
Wed Jan 29 03:17:02 +0000 2014 God bless SCF Cory Remsburg and all like him who don the uniform of the United States and go bravely into harm's way. #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 03:11:18 +0000 2014 Sanctions bill kicks in if negotiations fail.  strengthen POTUS hand; provide valuable insurance policy. can't understand y Obama opposed.
Wed Jan 29 03:08:03 +0000 2014 Iran has neither halted or rolled back the Iranian nuclear program. Naive and misleading. #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 03:04:09 +0000 2014 Iraq would be much different &amp; America safer if POTUS had not blown negotiations 4 residual force there like planned for Afghanistan. #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:58:46 +0000 2014 Congressional democrats cheers make it appear they're ready to follow Obama in defending ObamaCare. #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:58:07 +0000 2014 Let's do see if "the numbers add up," Mr. Obama. They haven't so far for your program. #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:56:31 +0000 2014 9 million: Claims credit for Medicaid sign ups in states that didn't expand Medicaid and claims credit for renewals as new signals. #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:55:47 +0000 2014 Let's see how many democratic senate candidates act same way. #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:55:31 +0000 2014 No remorse. No apology to millions who lost coverage because of ObamaCare or have higher premiums, larger deductibles.
Wed Jan 29 02:53:46 +0000 2014 He lectures congress about getting rid of Fannie and Freddie after blocking their shutdown. What's his plan?
Wed Jan 29 02:52:07 +0000 2014 Interested to see where POTUS thinks he has statutory authority to set up MyRA with federal guarantee without new law.
Wed Jan 29 02:50:43 +0000 2014 How many workers for federal contractors make the minimum wage?? This was a teeny tiny burp. #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:46:02 +0000 2014 So now the federal government is running our high schools, re-designing them? Are not local communities in charge? #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:43:55 +0000 2014 Of course, he couldn't credit no child left behind. Would've been generous and accurate. W/o NCLB his "race to the top" impossible.
Wed Jan 29 02:42:00 +0000 2014 What evidence does POTUS have that CEOs are deliberately NOT giving long term unemployed a fair shot at new jobs?
Wed Jan 29 02:39:55 +0000 2014 Is it me or does he seem more bored and detached than usual and a little irritated as he reads his script? #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:35:54 +0000 2014 Now he's promised to lock up more federal land. Energy production on fed land is down since Obama took office, up on private &amp; state land.
Wed Jan 29 02:35:13 +0000 2014 Oh, it was Obama's strategy that opened up the shale revolution &amp; reignited our oil industry. Not entrepreneurs &amp; energy industry he attacks
Wed Jan 29 02:34:01 +0000 2014 Trade promotion authority. 1 thing I agree with POTUS about. Of course, he's only 5 yrs late on paying attention to new trade agreements.
Wed Jan 29 02:31:34 +0000 2014 At current manuf job creation rate, it'll take about 20 years to get back to # of manuf jobs in dec 07. More manuf hubs won't solve that.
Wed Jan 29 02:29:05 +0000 2014 Will he finally "streamline the permitting process" for Keystone XL pipeline to show he's serious about this promise?? #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:28:38 +0000 2014 So we reform taxes to cut tax rates and spend lots more money?
Wed Jan 29 02:26:04 +0000 2014 Guess "whenever I can take steps w/o legislation" depends on whether he thinks he has stat authority 2 do so or just wants 2 take steps.
Wed Jan 29 02:24:15 +0000 2014 "Too many working more than ever just to get by." Maybe that's been because of Obama policies.  #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:22:22 +0000 2014 Congress got budget agreement bc Obama administration was on sideline, not because it was involved. #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:21:00 +0000 2014 The man who threatened the full faith &amp; credit of US in 2005 now lectures congress on the issue.
Wed Jan 29 02:20:09 +0000 2014 More oil DESPITE not because of Obama administration. What gall. #SOTU
Wed Jan 29 02:18:32 +0000 2014 8 m new jobs? Doesn't count jobs lost on his watch. Still take 6ms 2 get back 2 # working when he took office. Worse recovery in US history.
