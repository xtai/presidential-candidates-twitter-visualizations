Tue Jun 14 19:25:11 +0000 2016 @HawaiiDelilah @KaraCalavera i said he gave it because he thinks Trump is a threat to the nation. The Clinton thing was a side observation

Tue Jun 14 17:51:54 +0000 2016 @GiannaJax the first part is what i said and was my emphasis. the Clinton point was a side and later observation.
Tue Jun 14 17:49:30 +0000 2016 @BeautyofDamon @Orlijr i never said she was his project. there was nothing gender related in what i said in the slightest

Mon Jun 13 17:59:18 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG no one is challenging your views. it's about the Saudi government and its feet planted firmly in the 15th century
Mon Jun 13 17:58:17 +0000 2016 @lorshashass @Rose_Marie_Holt @fanazer_JTG madrassas throughout pakistan and uzbekistan, there have been dozens of studies of this
Mon Jun 13 17:34:48 +0000 2016 @Rose_Marie_Holt oh, youre talking to @fanazer_JTG ...good!
Mon Jun 13 17:32:57 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG i suppose the significance depends upon whether you're a member of any of those groups
Mon Jun 13 17:32:07 +0000 2016 @Rose_Marie_Holt @fanazer_JTG i'm sorry? you think the fact that Saudis fund globally intolerant extremist madrassas is propaganda?
Mon Jun 13 17:25:38 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG how tolerant is the Saudi government of gays, Christians, Jews, women who want equal rights?
Mon Jun 13 16:56:43 +0000 2016 @thomhickey55 i agree!
Mon Jun 13 16:12:51 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG you havent answered my question about tolerance of whom?
Mon Jun 13 16:11:34 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG we all know the Saudis play both sides, govt helps the west sometimes while allowing funding of terrorism/extremism
Mon Jun 13 16:06:57 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG really? so no intolerance towards gays? Christians? Jews? women who want equal rights?
Mon Jun 13 16:05:50 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG honestly, at this point, the Saudis are fooling no one paying any attention to the spread of violent jihadism.
Mon Jun 13 16:05:17 +0000 2016 @fanazer_JTG in terms of Saudi-funded extremist madrassas, there are many throughout Pakistan and Uzbekistan, for example. Do you deny it?
