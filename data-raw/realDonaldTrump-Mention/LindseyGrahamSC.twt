Fri May 06 17:41:07 +0000 2016 Finally, I do not plan to attend the Republican convention in Cleveland this summer. (8)

Fri May 06 17:32:04 +0000 2016 I also cannot in good conscience support Donald Trump because I do not believe he is a reliable Republican conservative....(4)

Wed May 04 01:02:40 +0000 2016 Great effort by the @TedCruz campaign to offer Republicans an alternative to Donald Trump and fight for conservatism.
Tue May 03 21:03:30 +0000 2016 If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.
Tue May 03 21:01:04 +0000 2016 Any doubt left Trump is completely unhinged? His assertion Ted Cruz’s father was associated with Lee Harvey Oswald should remove ALL doubt.

Wed Apr 27 17:27:09 +0000 2016 Trump’s FP speech not conservative. It’s isolationism surrounded by disconnected thought, demonstrates lack of understanding threats we face
Wed Apr 27 17:13:36 +0000 2016 Trump speech is pathetic in terms of understanding the role America plays in the world, how to win War on Terror, and threats we face.

Tue Sep 08 18:01:05 +0000 2015 Building a school for a young, poor girl will do more damage to Radical Islam than any bomb we can drop. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 18:00:33 +0000 2015 My goal as president is to achieve victory in the war on terror. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 18:00:18 +0000 2015 I'm best qualified to be Commander in Chief at a time we need somebody who knows what the hell they are doing. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:54:53 +0000 2015 Evil is doing very well on President Obama's watch. He's been a poor champion of freedom. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:54:31 +0000 2015 Doing what Obama is doing - plus a little bit - gets you nothing. We need to degrade and destroy ISIL. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:45:31 +0000 2015 No one on our side is addressing Syria in a coherent fashion. There is nobody left to destroy ISIL and push Assad out. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:45:10 +0000 2015 As to degrading and destroying ISIL - whatever it takes, as long as it takes, until they are destroyed. Period. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:45:02 +0000 2015 As president, I wouldn't give Iran a penny until they stopped being the largest state sponsor of terrorism on the planet. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:37:11 +0000 2015 The idea of containing the Ayatollah after he gets a nuke is a non-starter. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:37:01 +0000 2015 If this is such a good deal, why do we need to spend billions to give weapons to the Arabs? #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:36:53 +0000 2015 The fact that we're promising more weapons to everyone else in the region tells you all you need to know about this deal. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:36:44 +0000 2015 The answer to this dilemma is to make sure that America reasserts herself. It's time to set the world back in order. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:31:58 +0000 2015 We can already see that this is a bad deal. Everybody in the Mideast region is worried. Israel is adamently against this. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:31:48 +0000 2015 I find it offensive that my government would negotiate a deal with the UN and Iran that Congress can't see. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:29:42 +0000 2015 I look forward to the debate as to whether or not we should fund IAEA until we get a chance to see the side agreement. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:29:03 +0000 2015 To deny discussion on this deal would be one of the low points in history of US Senate. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:28:50 +0000 2015 President Obama can't get this deal. He has neither the will nor an understanding of the complexities of the Middle East. But I do #NPCLIVE

Tue Sep 08 17:21:53 +0000 2015 Obama says there’s no better deal to be had. Not from a POTUS who negotiates from weakness. But right POTUS will get right deal. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:21:46 +0000 2015 I am leading the effort to impose additional sanctions on the Iranian regime.  I will also block funding for the IAEA. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:21:37 +0000 2015 What did Iran get from the negotiation?  A deal that gives them nuclear bomb, missile to deliver it, &amp; money to pay for it. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:21:29 +0000 2015 In short, Iran set the entire Middle East on fire. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:21:15 +0000 2015 While Obama was backing down from every negotiating objective he had laid out, Iran was taking down the government of Yemen.  #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:21:06 +0000 2015 While the Obama Administration was giving away our ability to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, Iran giving rise to ISIL. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:20:58 +0000 2015 While Kerry was giving away the farm at the negotiating table, his State Dept was detailing Iran's terror campaign in Mideast.  #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:20:48 +0000 2015 We had a president who projected weakness and clearly didn’t understand who he was dealing with. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:20:41 +0000 2015 I helped lead this effort because I believe that the single greatest threat to our nat'l security is prospect of a nuclear Iran.  #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:16:12 +0000 2015 President Obama chose to remain on the sidelines.  The religious Nazis running Iran faced no consequences for their actions.  #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:15:57 +0000 2015 Losers of deal include American businesses &amp; officials cyber attacked by China, people of Ukraine, Syrians who suffer under Assad. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:15:44 +0000 2015 When history is written, I believe it will say that President Obama was a weak opponent of evil &amp; poor champion of freedom. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:09:22 +0000 2015 To my Democratic colleagues who say this agreement saves Israel and secures its future, I couldn’t disagree more strongly. #NPCLIVE
Tue Sep 08 17:09:07 +0000 2015 President Obama’s deal with Iran could only be reached through a long series of mistakes and miscalculations.  #NPCLIVE

Wed Aug 05 16:59:16 +0000 2015 Clearly, President Obama does not understand the Middle East and has made one blunder after another. #IranDeal
Wed Aug 05 16:58:55 +0000 2015 Instead, POTUS #IranDeal empowers Iran with pathway to bomb, missiles to deliver it, money to pay for it, and means to a military arsenal.
Wed Aug 05 16:58:31 +0000 2015 The alternative to #IranDeal was never war; it was greater pressure on Iran and insistence on a better agreement.
Wed Aug 05 16:58:06 +0000 2015 No one believes that diplomacy = weakness. We object to POTUS belief that diplomacy doesn't need to be backed up w/ credible force #IranDeal

Mon Jun 01 16:31:18 +0000 2015 To understand where we're headed, we have to remember where we came from. It all started in Central, SC: https://t.co/61iuId738g
Mon Jun 01 15:33:29 +0000 2015 I humbly ask for your support and your vote.  I will work everyday to make you proud. Thank you, and God Bless.
Mon Jun 01 15:33:13 +0000 2015 I’ll fight each day harder than I fought the day before to keep this country safe, prosperous and as good as the people who made it great.
Mon Jun 01 15:31:01 +0000 2015 I want to do more than make big government smaller. I want to help make a great nation greater.
Mon Jun 01 15:30:34 +0000 2015 To those who trust neither party, I'll seek the political common ground our nation so desperately needs to find. It’s what I’ve done before.
Mon Jun 01 15:30:11 +0000 2015 My enemies are those who despise our shared values: the enemies of enlightenment... We’ll fight them together with our partners &amp; we’ll win.
Mon Jun 01 15:29:52 +0000 2015 To my friends in the other party: Our differences are real, and we’ll debate them. But you’re not my enemy. You’re my fellow countrymen.
Mon Jun 01 15:29:19 +0000 2015 I’ll be a champion for limited &amp; effective government, strong nat'l defense &amp; for social conservative values w/o apology or animosity.
Mon Jun 01 15:26:13 +0000 2015 Those who believe the best way to defend ourselves is to lead the world &amp; make history rather than be overwhelmed by it, I ask for your help
Mon Jun 01 15:23:24 +0000 2015 I have more experience with our national security than any other candidate...that includes you @HillaryClinton.
Mon Jun 01 15:22:40 +0000 2015 I’m running for President because I am ready to be Commander-in-Chief on day one.
Mon Jun 01 15:22:21 +0000 2015 We’ve learned over the past 6 years that speeches alone won’t make us safer. Superior power and resolve will.

Mon Jun 01 15:20:55 +0000 2015 Our allies feel the absence of America’s leadership. Our adversaries are taking advantage. American weakness anywhere hurts us everywhere.
Mon Jun 01 15:19:51 +0000 2015 The most powerful weapon in our arsenal isn’t a gun. It’s an idea. Terrorists are selling a glorious death. We must sell a hopeful life.
Mon Jun 01 15:19:21 +0000 2015 To our friends in Israel, I will never abandon you. I will always stand firm in supporting the one and only Jewish state.
Mon Jun 01 15:18:50 +0000 2015 Our ally Israel is at risk as a result of Obama’s failed leadership. We share values, we share democracy, &amp; our friendship is unbreakable.

Sun Apr 12 21:22:44 +0000 2015 Along with gaining the people's trust, Hillary Clinton's greatest challenge will be overcoming her close ties to failed foreign policy.
Sun Apr 12 20:07:05 +0000 2015 Hillary Clinton would continue the same failed policies of this administration.  It would be a third term of Barack Obama.
Sun Apr 12 19:49:05 +0000 2015 The middle class is getting screwed by the administration’s domestic agenda &amp; I believe it would be more of the same with Clinton.
Sun Apr 12 19:30:18 +0000 2015 Hillary Clinton owns the president’s foreign policy &amp; she owns his domestic policy.   How would she be different?
