Mon Sep 28 17:03:09 +0000 2015 But this isn't just about what I can do as President. Every single one of us - from citizens to NGOs - can help refugees find safe haven.
Mon Sep 28 17:01:48 +0000 2015 We're also increasing the number of Syrian and other refugees we admit to the U.S. to 100,000 per year for the next two years.
Mon Sep 28 17:00:08 +0000 2015 We've provided more than $4.5 billion in humanitarian aid to help meet the needs of those impacted by the Syrian conflict.
Mon Sep 28 16:58:34 +0000 2015 Nearly 12 million people have been displaced by the conflict in Syria. As Americans, we can't sit idly by. That's not who we are.
Sat Sep 26 23:15:51 +0000 2015 I'm grateful for the teachers who helped spark my sense of curiosity. The #62MillionGirls who aren't in school should have that same chance.

Wed Sep 16 16:58:54 +0000 2015 Cool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great.
Tue Sep 15 20:36:39 +0000 2015 We've fought back because of you. We shouldn't slip back because of Congress. I urge them to send me a budget that invests in our future.
Tue Sep 15 20:33:37 +0000 2015 When I took office, the budget deficit had reached 9.2% of our GDP. We've cut that down to 2.8%. http://t.co/3viaw4b0bB

Wed Aug 05 20:45:23 +0000 2015 The choice is ultimately between diplomacy and war. Iran's nuclear program accelerates if Congress kills this deal. https://t.co/nvBeO1Omko
Wed Aug 05 20:36:48 +0000 2015 It's the strongest nuclear deal ever negotiated. There's no such thing as a "better deal." Walking away risks war. https://t.co/la7GhQXfzl
Mon Aug 03 19:29:02 +0000 2015 I refuse to condemn our kids to a planet that's beyond fixing. Let's meet this challenge and #ActOnClimate together.

Mon Aug 03 19:15:25 +0000 2015 It's time to change that. With the Clean Power Plan, by 2030, carbon pollution from power plants will be 32% lower than it was a decade ago.
Mon Aug 03 19:11:58 +0000 2015 Right now, power plants account for about one-third of America’s carbon pollution. That’s more than our cars, airplanes, and homes combined.
Mon Aug 03 19:06:54 +0000 2015 Levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are higher than they’ve been in 800,000 years. 2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.
Mon Aug 03 19:06:08 +0000 2015 Today, we're announcing America's Clean Power Plan—the most important step we've ever taken to combat climate change. Here are the facts:
Sat Aug 01 19:25:04 +0000 2015 Hey @StationCDRKelly, loving the photos. Do you ever look out the window and just freak out?

Tue Jul 14 22:47:13 +0000 2015 Mass incarceration doesn't work. Let's build communities that give kids a shot at success and prisons that prepare people for a 2nd chance.
Tue Jul 14 22:42:16 +0000 2015 We could eliminate tuition at every public college and university in America with the $80 billion we spend each year on incarcerations.
Tue Jul 14 22:37:43 +0000 2015 The $80 billion we spend each year on incarcerations could double the salary of every high school teacher in America.
Tue Jul 14 22:34:32 +0000 2015 The $80 billion we spend each year to keep people incarcerated could pay for universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America.
Tue Jul 14 22:30:51 +0000 2015 In 1980, there were 500,000 people in American jails. Today, there are 2.2 million. Many belong. But too many are nonviolent offenders.
Tue Jul 14 22:26:15 +0000 2015 America keeps more people behind bars than the top 35 European countries combined.
Tue Jul 14 22:20:49 +0000 2015 America is home to 5% of the world's population, but 25% of the world's prisoners.
Tue Jul 14 22:19:14 +0000 2015 Just spoke to the NAACP about criminal justice reform, something many broadly agree on. Some stats:
Fri Jul 10 14:12:50 +0000 2015 South Carolina taking down the confederate flag - a signal of good will and healing, and a meaningful step towards a better future.

Thu Jun 25 17:13:26 +0000 2015 The uninsured rate is the lowest it's ever been. Let's keep at it until every American has quality, affordable health insurance.
Thu Jun 25 16:56:11 +0000 2015 More than 137 million Americans have guaranteed access to preventive care like cancer screenings and birth control at no out-of-pocket cost.
