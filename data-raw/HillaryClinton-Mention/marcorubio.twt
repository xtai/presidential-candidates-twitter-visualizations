Mon Jul 06 13:29:00 +0000 2015 My goal is a free Cuba. Lifting the embargo with no meaningful reforms will only strengthen Castro regime
Mon Jul 06 12:04:18 +0000 2015 For the record, I'm proud that the Castro regime feels threatened by us. They fear freedom and democracy.

Fri Jun 26 18:05:28 +0000 2015 In the years ahead, it is my hope that each side will respect the dignity of the other.
Fri Jun 26 18:05:19 +0000 2015 ...and a large number of Americans will be pleased with the Court’s decision today.
Fri Jun 26 18:05:14 +0000 2015 A large number of Americans will continue to believe in traditional marriage....
Fri Jun 26 18:05:07 +0000 2015 ...and millions of Americans whose faiths hold a traditional view of marriage.
Fri Jun 26 18:05:01 +0000 2015 The next president and all in public office must strive to protect the First Amendment rights of religious institutions...
Fri Jun 26 18:04:57 +0000 2015 While I disagree with this decision, we live in a republic and must abide by the law.
Fri Jun 26 18:04:53 +0000 2015 This decision short-circuits the political process that has been underway on the state level for years.
Fri Jun 26 18:04:47 +0000 2015 That is the right of our people, not the right of the unelected judges or justices of the Supreme Court.
Fri Jun 26 18:04:37 +0000 2015 People who disagree with the traditional definition of marriage have the right to change their state laws.
Fri Jun 26 18:04:24 +0000 2015 ...and should be between one man and one woman.
Fri Jun 26 18:04:18 +0000 2015 I believe that marriage, as the key to strong family life, is the most important institution in our society...

Thu Jun 25 14:32:32 +0000 2015 Despite the Court’s decision, ObamaCare is still a bad law that is having a negative impact on our country and on millions of Americans.
Thu Jun 25 14:32:20 +0000 2015 ...and Congress in forcing ObamaCare on the American people.
Thu Jun 25 14:32:14 +0000 2015 I disagree with the Court’s ruling and believe they have once again erred in trying to correct the mistakes made by President Obama...
