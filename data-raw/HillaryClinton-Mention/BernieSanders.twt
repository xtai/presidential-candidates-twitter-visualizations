Fri Aug 12 20:32:06 +0000 2016 We can lift this cap so that everyone making over $250k a year pays into Social Security and extend its solvency for the next 50 years.

Fri Aug 12 14:13:30 +0000 2016 Trump's plan to repeal the estate tax alone would give a $269 billion tax break over a 10-year period to the top two-tenths of 1 percent.
Fri Aug 12 14:09:51 +0000 2016 Meanwhile, Trump is proposing huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires while gutting the Department of Education and the EPA.

Fri Aug 12 13:59:28 +0000 2016 Wanna know why Trump believes wages are too high in the U.S.?  He is used to paying 30 cents an hour in low-wage countries abroad.
Fri Aug 12 13:57:39 +0000 2016 Donald says he will "fix" trade.  He can start by shutting down his own sweatshops in Bangladesh and pay workers in the U.S. a living wage.

Thu Aug 11 17:30:25 +0000 2016 Keeping marijuana in the same category as heroin is absurd. The time is long overdue for us to remove the federal prohibition on marijuana.
Thu Aug 11 16:37:09 +0000 2016 By expanding worker-owned businesses we can create stronger companies throughout the country and improve working conditions for employees.

Tue Jul 26 02:57:32 +0000 2016 Many here are disappointed. I think it’s fair to say that no one is more disappointed than I am. But take pride in what we've accomplished.
Tue Jul 26 02:55:46 +0000 2016 And to my delegates: Thank you for all the work you’ve done. I look forward to your votes during the roll call on Tuesday night.

Mon Jul 25 17:16:15 +0000 2016 I've said it since day one: this campaign is about more than electing a president. It is about enacting a progressive agenda across America!
Mon Jul 25 16:35:54 +0000 2016 We need a party which is prepared to stand up for the 47 million people in this country who are living in poverty!
Mon Jul 25 13:33:32 +0000 2016 In the State of New York 3 million Independent voters could not participate in the Democratic nominee process. It's time for open primaries.

Sun Jul 24 01:45:02 +0000 2016 It is time for us to have a government which represents all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors.
Sat Jul 23 23:05:20 +0000 2016 At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, we need tax policies that demand that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes.
Sat Jul 23 20:17:56 +0000 2016 The toxic chemicals used in fracking are known to cause lung cancer and birth defects. We must ban fracking and #KeepItInTheGround.
Sat Jul 23 17:25:34 +0000 2016 No amount of regulation can safely guard against the dangers fracking poses to our land, water, air, natural resources and public health.
Sat Jul 23 14:09:17 +0000 2016 We need to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next few years, and implement pay equity for women workers.
Sat Jul 23 01:23:09 +0000 2016 Fracking is a danger to our water supply, the air we breathe and it’s contributing to climate change. Time to phase out fracking nationwide.
Fri Jul 22 23:41:04 +0000 2016 With real unemployment near 10 percent, we need a jobs program to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and create millions of jobs.
Fri Jul 22 21:21:01 +0000 2016 Both the @EPA and the @theNASciences have shown clear evidence that hydraulic fracturing can lead to a contaminated water supply.
Fri Jul 22 19:38:08 +0000 2016 RT @TulsiGabbard: People are frustrated with the same-old politics as usual. The problem is simple: too many of our leaders have forgotten…
Fri Jul 22 16:09:42 +0000 2016 The time is long overdue for us to create an economy which works for the middle class of this country, and not just the 1 percent.
Fri Jul 22 13:48:08 +0000 2016 Billions of dollars are being funneled into our elections in a form of legalized bribery.
Fri Jul 22 03:23:59 +0000 2016 Trump’s Supreme Court nominees would, like Scalia, oppose a woman’s right to choose, support Citizens United and gut the Voting Rights Act.
Fri Jul 22 03:17:07 +0000 2016 Trump’s economic plan: let states lower the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, already a starvation wage.
Fri Jul 22 03:15:44 +0000 2016 Trump’s economic plan: same old, same old trickle-down economics. Pathetic. #RNCwithBernie
Fri Jul 22 02:54:34 +0000 2016 Will there be one word about student debt or making college affordable? Or just concerned about more tax breaks for the rich? #RNCwithBernie
Fri Jul 22 02:49:36 +0000 2016 Trump thinks climate change is a “hoax.” My supporters understand that we must move away from fossil fuels, not expand them. #RNCwithBernie
Fri Jul 22 02:48:50 +0000 2016 Our movement understands that what we don't need is Trump's huge tax breaks for millionaires. #RNCwithBernie
Fri Jul 22 02:48:14 +0000 2016 Looks like Ted Cruz was right about one thing. Trump does not understand what the Constitution is about. #RNCwithBernie
Fri Jul 22 02:47:45 +0000 2016 Trump: “I alone can fix this.” Maybe he doesn’t understand that a president has to work with Congress. #RNCwithBernie
Fri Jul 22 02:47:18 +0000 2016 Trump: “I alone can fix this.” Is this guy running for president or dictator? #RNCwithBernie
Fri Jul 22 02:46:53 +0000 2016 Still waiting for a single word about covering the 28 million Americans without health insurance. I guess they don’t matter much to Trump.
Fri Jul 22 02:46:04 +0000 2016 Citizens United is one of the worst decisions in our history. Will Trump mention it or is he too afraid of the Koch brothers? #RNCwithBernie

Fri Jul 22 02:34:42 +0000 2016 Trump is wrong. The real cause of instability in the Middle East was the Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq. By the way, where is President Bush?
Fri Jul 22 02:29:34 +0000 2016 We believe in bringing people together, not dividing them up.

Thu Jul 21 23:11:04 +0000 2016 Every American over 18 must be automatically registered to vote so that young people can make their voices heard at the ballot box.
Thu Jul 21 21:08:13 +0000 2016 We must put an end to discriminatory laws and the purging of minority-community names from voting rolls.
Thu Jul 21 18:46:04 +0000 2016 Change comes when the people demand it — in the voting booth and on the streets in peaceful demonstrations.
Thu Jul 21 16:47:52 +0000 2016 We must remember that the struggle for our rights is not the struggle of a day, or a year. It is the struggle of a lifetime.
Thu Jul 21 15:03:44 +0000 2016 When the votes of minorities are suppressed, it becomes easier for politicians who represent billionaires to win and hold elected office.
Thu Jul 21 13:32:07 +0000 2016 I have a message for Donald Trump: No, we’re not going to hate Latinos or Muslims. We are going to stand together.
Thu Jul 21 01:56:07 +0000 2016 Make no mistake: the billionaire class does not want young and working people to vote.
Thu Jul 21 00:23:03 +0000 2016 In the shameful days of open segregation, literacy laws were used to suppress minority voting. Today, Republicans do it with photo ID laws.
Wed Jul 20 22:52:05 +0000 2016 Through a Prize Fund we can provide affordable access to medicines as soon as they are available on the market.
Wed Jul 20 22:32:02 +0000 2016 The prices of patented medicines are a significant barrier to access to health for millions Americans and people die because of it.
Wed Jul 20 20:59:07 +0000 2016 It should offend the conscience of every American when the votes of minorities are suppressed. https://t.co/mv7a2hlj8Q
Wed Jul 20 18:39:18 +0000 2016 Poverty should not be a death sentence, neither in the United States nor anywhere else.  Yet it is, much to our disgrace.
Wed Jul 20 16:08:51 +0000 2016 We will defeat Donald Trump because we know that love trumps hatred. https://t.co/Cx92gzemgo
Wed Jul 20 13:48:04 +0000 2016 It’s fun for the media to treat Trump like a character in a soap opera, but the truth is his language is dangerous.
Wed Jul 20 01:48:05 +0000 2016 In my view, it makes a lot more sense to be investing in jobs and education, than more jails and incarceration.
Tue Jul 19 23:23:03 +0000 2016 We must once again make our country the leader in the fight for economic and social justice, for environmental sanity and for peace.
Tue Jul 19 21:27:48 +0000 2016 If @realDonaldTrump wants to open the door to racism, it is our job to shut that door, and shut it tight.
Tue Jul 19 19:37:52 +0000 2016 The greed of the billionaire class is destroying this country and whether they like it or not we are going to stop that greed.
Tue Jul 19 16:41:04 +0000 2016 I believe we have a moral obligation to pursue diplomatic solutions before resorting to military intervention.
Tue Jul 19 15:10:13 +0000 2016 Trump suggested limiting immigration according to religion and creating a national database based on religion – absolutely disgraceful.
Tue Jul 19 14:03:07 +0000 2016 To advance the cause of peace, the United States has also got to be a friend not only to Israel, but to the Palestinian people.
Tue Jul 19 01:12:05 +0000 2016 We have got to say to the fossil-fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.
Mon Jul 18 23:02:04 +0000 2016 At a time of massive inequality, the Republicans believe that the richest people in America need to be made even richer.
Mon Jul 18 20:42:15 +0000 2016 I hope the Republicans listen to what the Pope has to say. Denying the science related to climate change is no longer acceptable.
Mon Jul 18 17:52:17 +0000 2016 What we've accomplished so far is historic – but our work is far from over. This political revolution must continue. https://t.co/W6sceUdv4I
Mon Jul 18 15:54:06 +0000 2016 Today in America we not only have an absence level of wealth and income inequality, we have a power structure that protects that inequality.
Mon Jul 18 13:54:22 +0000 2016 Lifting the cap on Social Security would increase cost-of-living-adjustments and increase minimum benefits paid to low-income seniors.
Mon Jul 18 01:27:19 +0000 2016 Our younger generation may have a lower standard of living than their parents. This is not what America is about. https://t.co/pEuFOF2Iwo
Mon Jul 18 00:02:07 +0000 2016 I'm asking people across the nation to come together and organize an unprecedented grassroots movement.
Sun Jul 17 18:47:03 +0000 2016 Together we're going to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision which has allowed millionaires to buy politicians.
Sun Jul 17 14:29:49 +0000 2016 Despite what the media tells you, politics is not a soap opera. Politics is about coming together to improve the lives of all.
Sun Jul 17 00:34:02 +0000 2016 We need a grassroots movement to tell the Koch brothers and the billionaire class that they won't be able to continue to buy elections.
Sat Jul 16 22:21:06 +0000 2016 We are building a movement because this country belongs to all of us - not just a handful of billionaires and wealthy campaign contributors.
Sat Jul 16 20:55:07 +0000 2016 No president alone can effectively address the crises facing the working families of this country without a powerful grassroots movement.
Sat Jul 16 18:25:08 +0000 2016 At what point will Congress have the courage to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and say enough is enough?
Sat Jul 16 16:06:01 +0000 2016 American pharmaceutical companies couple outrageous prices on drugs with new and inventive ways to avoid paying taxes. It's truly shameless.

Fri Jul 15 22:26:29 +0000 2016 We must allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and reduce the barriers to importing prescription drugs from Canada and other countries.

Wed Jun 22 13:49:02 +0000 2016 Sadly, the current Democratic leadership has turned its back on dozens of states and allowed right-wing politicians to win elections.
Wed Jun 22 00:12:01 +0000 2016 We must resist all efforts to cut Social Security. Instead, we've gotta fight to expand benefits for our seniors and disabled veterans.

Fri Jun 10 14:01:42 +0000 2016 Our job is to bring the American people together to create a government that works for us, not the 1 percent.

Thu Jun 09 16:27:05 +0000 2016 But you all know it is more than Bernie Sanders. It is all of us together. Millions of people from coast to coast coming together.
Thu Jun 09 14:48:04 +0000 2016 When millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, we won't allow 57 percent of all new income to go to the top 1 percent.
Thu Jun 09 14:46:54 +0000 2016 I'm horrified by yesterday's terrorist attack in Tel Aviv. My thoughts are with the victims' families and all of those harmed.
Thu Jun 09 13:06:05 +0000 2016 The American people know that it is not acceptable that the top tenth of 1 percent owns as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent.
Thu Jun 09 01:22:05 +0000 2016 Our mission is more than just defeating Trump. It is transforming our country. People want something to vote for rather than just against.
Wed Jun 08 23:12:06 +0000 2016 The American people will never support a candidate whose major theme is bigotry. We will not allow Donald Trump to become president.
Wed Jun 08 21:02:05 +0000 2016 We will not allow right-wing Republicans to control our government. That is especially true with Donald Trump as the Republican candidate.
Wed Jun 08 19:56:01 +0000 2016 Young people understand that they are the future of America, and they intend to help shape that future.

Fri Apr 08 23:36:49 +0000 2016 That's just a "single issue" where @HillaryClinton and I differ.
Fri Apr 08 23:33:28 +0000 2016 In my view, we need to repeal the 1996 welfare reform provisions and expand, not weaken, the social safety net.
Fri Apr 08 23:24:30 +0000 2016 In 2008, @HillaryClinton said that “welfare should not be an anti-poverty program.” I disagree.
Fri Apr 08 23:22:51 +0000 2016 This legislation has weakened the social safety net and increased extreme poverty. That is unacceptable.
Fri Apr 08 23:21:46 +0000 2016 This legislation gave Republican governors like Scott Walker the responsibility to provide a safety net for families in need.
Fri Apr 08 23:15:26 +0000 2016 In 1994, welfare provided a vital safety net to more than 14 million Americans. Today, it only helps 4.4 million.
Fri Apr 08 23:13:31 +0000 2016 Families LIVING IN POVERTY receiving cash benefits: 1996: 68% 2014: Only 23%
Fri Apr 08 23:11:58 +0000 2016 From 1996 to 2011, households living in EXTREME poverty increased 182% for African Americans; 132% for Hispanics; 109% for White Americans.
Fri Apr 08 23:09:26 +0000 2016 The number of children in extreme poverty has skyrocketed from 1.4 million to 3.5 million.
Fri Apr 08 23:07:44 +0000 2016 It established strict work requirements for receiving benefits and severely limited access to benefits for undocumented people.
Fri Apr 08 23:03:51 +0000 2016 Since this legislation was signed into law, families living in extreme poverty have more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.65 million.
Fri Apr 08 23:00:49 +0000 2016 It turns out that the welfare reform bill has been an absolute disaster.
Fri Apr 08 22:57:03 +0000 2016 Unfortunately, @HillaryClinton supported this bill calling it “a critical first step to reforming our nation’s welfare system.”
Fri Apr 08 22:53:40 +0000 2016 I called that bill “an assault on the poor, women and children, minorities, and immigrants.” I believed that then and I believe that now.
Fri Apr 08 22:51:18 +0000 2016 One of the biggest differences between the Clintons and myself in this campaign is our view on welfare reform. https://t.co/kuBG52HAhj
Fri Apr 08 21:44:05 +0000 2016 It wasn't Governor Cuomo who had the idea to raise the minimum wage. It was the people telling him what to do. That's how change happens.

Fri Mar 25 14:23:07 +0000 2016 For the last 40 years the great middle class of our country — once the envy of the world — has been disappearing.
Fri Mar 25 12:31:05 +0000 2016 We have more people in jail than any other country. Lives are destroyed as we spend $80 billion locking up fellow Americans.

Sun Mar 20 23:10:05 +0000 2016 In 2003, I voted against the War in Iraq. It was a hard vote to cast when so many were calling for war.
Sun Mar 20 23:04:06 +0000 2016 That starts with defending veterans’ benefits from attempts to cut them in our Congress.
Sun Mar 20 22:59:05 +0000 2016 In the wake of that war, we must never forget the incredible sacrifices made by our veterans.
