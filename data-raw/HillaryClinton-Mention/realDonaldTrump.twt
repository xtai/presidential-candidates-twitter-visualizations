Mon Aug 01 18:47:54 +0000 2016 People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
Mon Aug 01 18:46:58 +0000 2016 The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
Mon Aug 01 18:45:22 +0000 2016 Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?

Sat Jul 30 22:12:36 +0000 2016 The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!
Sat Jul 30 22:04:14 +0000 2016 Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP
Sat Jul 30 21:55:48 +0000 2016 #CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaql
Sat Jul 30 21:51:25 +0000 2016 Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
Sat Jul 30 20:01:32 +0000 2016 I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!
Sat Jul 30 19:55:26 +0000 2016 Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings

Sat Jul 30 18:07:07 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!
Sat Jul 30 18:06:17 +0000 2016 Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
Sat Jul 30 16:29:17 +0000 2016 Just got back from Colorado. The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible. Big crowds!

Sat Jul 30 12:57:48 +0000 2016 We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
Sat Jul 30 12:54:44 +0000 2016 Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars,  NAFTA/TPP support &amp; Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.
Sat Jul 30 12:53:39 +0000 2016 Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

Fri Jul 29 14:06:38 +0000 2016 If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary
Fri Jul 29 13:59:42 +0000 2016 "Little" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!

Fri Jul 29 13:44:54 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

Fri Jul 29 12:51:13 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
Fri Jul 29 12:40:10 +0000 2016 The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
Fri Jul 29 03:59:04 +0000 2016 No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
Fri Jul 29 03:57:06 +0000 2016 Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
Fri Jul 29 03:54:22 +0000 2016 Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
Fri Jul 29 03:52:46 +0000 2016 Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
Fri Jul 29 03:50:59 +0000 2016 Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
Fri Jul 29 03:47:56 +0000 2016 Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

Thu Jul 28 20:31:59 +0000 2016 A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees.

Wed Jul 27 13:01:03 +0000 2016 Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
Wed Jul 27 12:57:20 +0000 2016 Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
Wed Jul 27 10:08:35 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
Wed Jul 27 10:01:39 +0000 2016 Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
Wed Jul 27 09:50:55 +0000 2016 The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
Wed Jul 27 09:43:16 +0000 2016 Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!
Wed Jul 27 09:33:52 +0000 2016 As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.

Wed Jul 27 02:02:24 +0000 2016 No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!

Tue Jul 26 12:38:27 +0000 2016 Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
Tue Jul 26 12:34:19 +0000 2016 Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference
Tue Jul 26 03:19:38 +0000 2016 Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
Tue Jul 26 03:12:57 +0000 2016 Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
Tue Jul 26 03:04:56 +0000 2016 Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
Tue Jul 26 02:14:29 +0000 2016 If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
Mon Jul 25 21:57:14 +0000 2016 I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
Mon Jul 25 21:45:54 +0000 2016 Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
Mon Jul 25 21:33:49 +0000 2016 While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
Mon Jul 25 21:32:59 +0000 2016 Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Mon Jul 25 13:47:45 +0000 2016 Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
Mon Jul 25 13:42:55 +0000 2016 Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
Mon Jul 25 13:19:18 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
Mon Jul 25 12:27:35 +0000 2016 If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
Mon Jul 25 12:26:56 +0000 2016 Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam
Mon Jul 25 12:02:01 +0000 2016 Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
Mon Jul 25 11:57:17 +0000 2016 How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
Mon Jul 25 11:31:22 +0000 2016 The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me
Sun Jul 24 23:59:10 +0000 2016 Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!
Sun Jul 24 23:47:08 +0000 2016 The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
Sun Jul 24 22:33:42 +0000 2016 The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
Sun Jul 24 22:16:59 +0000 2016 The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!
Sun Jul 24 22:07:49 +0000 2016 Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
Sun Jul 24 22:02:42 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
Sun Jul 24 21:53:29 +0000 2016 If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
Sun Jul 24 20:45:31 +0000 2016 The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
Sun Jul 24 20:30:06 +0000 2016 I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
Sun Jul 24 20:20:57 +0000 2016 Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)
Sun Jul 24 13:30:59 +0000 2016 Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
Sun Jul 24 13:27:56 +0000 2016 There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
Sun Jul 24 12:30:15 +0000 2016 An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
Sun Jul 24 12:15:51 +0000 2016 Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
Sun Jul 24 11:56:43 +0000 2016 Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
Sun Jul 24 11:25:06 +0000 2016 Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
Sun Jul 24 11:16:15 +0000 2016 The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

Sat Jul 23 15:01:48 +0000 2016 Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Sat Jul 23 14:51:32 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
Sat Jul 23 10:55:20 +0000 2016 Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
Sat Jul 23 10:42:10 +0000 2016 Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
Sat Jul 23 10:35:37 +0000 2016 Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
Sat Jul 23 10:31:18 +0000 2016 The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
Sat Jul 23 03:56:38 +0000 2016 "@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"
Sat Jul 23 03:49:04 +0000 2016 I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
Sat Jul 23 03:23:15 +0000 2016 Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
Fri Jul 22 23:03:19 +0000 2016 Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.
Fri Jul 22 14:06:01 +0000 2016 One of the best produced, including the incredible stage &amp; set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove

Wed Jul 20 17:02:19 +0000 2016 STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH https://t.co/uzBOm21Pug
Wed Jul 20 15:36:06 +0000 2016 The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
Wed Jul 20 15:31:15 +0000 2016 Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
Wed Jul 20 12:51:58 +0000 2016 In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!
Wed Jul 20 12:47:56 +0000 2016 Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.
Wed Jul 20 10:18:17 +0000 2016 Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!

Sun Jul 17 21:26:50 +0000 2016 President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse!
Sun Jul 17 21:22:23 +0000 2016 Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching. We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough!

Sun Jul 17 13:09:02 +0000 2016 The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like
Sun Jul 17 13:04:10 +0000 2016 .@FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.
Sun Jul 17 12:24:04 +0000 2016 If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H
Sun Jul 17 12:14:46 +0000 2016 I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!
Sun Jul 17 12:06:18 +0000 2016 It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!
Sun Jul 17 11:55:21 +0000 2016 As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!
Sun Jul 17 04:19:05 +0000 2016 We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!
Sun Jul 17 04:15:49 +0000 2016 Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over

Sat Jul 16 13:23:17 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!
Sat Jul 16 13:19:11 +0000 2016 Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
Sat Jul 16 13:13:56 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!
Sat Jul 16 13:08:43 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done

Thu Jul 14 17:23:58 +0000 2016 I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with NAFTA.

Wed Jul 13 22:28:44 +0000 2016 If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!
Wed Jul 13 22:27:45 +0000 2016 Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?
Wed Jul 13 22:26:20 +0000 2016 Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
Wed Jul 13 22:23:40 +0000 2016 On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
Wed Jul 13 22:22:20 +0000 2016 Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
Wed Jul 13 22:19:48 +0000 2016 Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!

Tue Jul 12 17:03:44 +0000 2016 Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Tue Jul 12 17:01:51 +0000 2016 Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

Tue Jul 12 13:36:47 +0000 2016 Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!

Sun Jul 10 18:58:10 +0000 2016 I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily, few people are watching - dead network!
Sun Jul 10 18:42:32 +0000 2016 The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!
Sun Jul 10 18:27:58 +0000 2016 President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
Sun Jul 10 12:02:02 +0000 2016 Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!

Wed Jul 06 14:01:09 +0000 2016 Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.
Wed Jul 06 13:24:50 +0000 2016 Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
Wed Jul 06 13:12:43 +0000 2016 Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City
Wed Jul 06 13:08:44 +0000 2016 I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
Wed Jul 06 12:31:27 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!
Wed Jul 06 12:11:03 +0000 2016 The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj https://t.co/8CBSfNpl2l
Wed Jul 06 11:21:34 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
Wed Jul 06 11:12:45 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!
Wed Jul 06 04:36:31 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
Wed Jul 06 04:30:04 +0000 2016 I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out!
Wed Jul 06 04:23:03 +0000 2016 Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win

Tue Jul 05 15:39:06 +0000 2016 FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
Tue Jul 05 15:37:23 +0000 2016 The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.
Tue Jul 05 12:05:46 +0000 2016 It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
Tue Jul 05 11:14:58 +0000 2016 Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!

Mon Jul 04 22:30:15 +0000 2016 Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
Mon Jul 04 15:34:15 +0000 2016 With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
Mon Jul 04 15:26:56 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?

Mon Jul 04 13:56:34 +0000 2016 Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!
Mon Jul 04 13:42:16 +0000 2016 Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!

Mon Jul 04 12:00:11 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
Mon Jul 04 11:54:40 +0000 2016 The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
Mon Jul 04 11:35:16 +0000 2016 In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
Sun Jul 03 21:46:58 +0000 2016 I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
Sun Jul 03 21:43:25 +0000 2016 The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."
Sun Jul 03 21:38:20 +0000 2016 Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
Sun Jul 03 21:00:39 +0000 2016 "THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"
Sun Jul 03 20:47:51 +0000 2016 On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
Sun Jul 03 20:20:20 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged &amp; corrupt!
Sun Jul 03 20:16:23 +0000 2016 Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
Sun Jul 03 17:40:49 +0000 2016 Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!
Sat Jul 02 21:13:02 +0000 2016 It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
Sat Jul 02 20:39:39 +0000 2016 It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

Fri Jul 01 12:12:48 +0000 2016 Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
Fri Jul 01 12:12:06 +0000 2016 Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
Fri Jul 01 12:11:41 +0000 2016 As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

Thu Jun 30 19:30:54 +0000 2016 The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Thu Jun 30 19:30:20 +0000 2016 I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
Thu Jun 30 19:29:48 +0000 2016 The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!
Thu Jun 30 19:28:27 +0000 2016 One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.  https://t.co/mO9QrmYXRD

Wed Jun 29 13:09:49 +0000 2016 The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker. China, and many others, are taking advantage of U.S. with our terrible trade pacts

Mon Jun 06 13:51:31 +0000 2016 I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff. But small is good, flexible, save money and number one!
Mon Jun 06 13:42:53 +0000 2016 A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report. That's REALLY bad!
Mon Jun 06 13:23:54 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud!
Mon Jun 06 13:15:19 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!

Tue May 24 11:42:35 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
Tue May 24 10:41:44 +0000 2016 I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
Tue May 24 02:50:48 +0000 2016 Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
Tue May 24 02:46:08 +0000 2016 Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.

Sun May 22 19:37:05 +0000 2016 How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women?

Sun May 22 03:55:39 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom. Wrong!

Fri May 20 10:08:49 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!
Fri May 20 09:58:47 +0000 2016 Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance!
Fri May 20 09:47:09 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years!
Fri May 20 09:40:37 +0000 2016 I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing!

Mon May 16 13:09:26 +0000 2016 The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!

Wed May 11 20:41:51 +0000 2016 Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump &amp; gets nothing done in Senate?
Wed May 11 20:22:28 +0000 2016 Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See media—asking for increase!
Wed May 11 20:03:35 +0000 2016 Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn’t care less about the American worker…does nothing to help!

Fri Apr 29 13:46:49 +0000 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!
Fri Apr 29 11:22:04 +0000 2016 Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!

Mon Apr 25 16:16:27 +0000 2016 On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
Mon Apr 25 16:15:58 +0000 2016 Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
Mon Apr 25 11:59:06 +0000 2016 Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Mon Apr 25 11:54:21 +0000 2016 Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
Mon Apr 25 03:49:17 +0000 2016 Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
Mon Apr 25 03:39:58 +0000 2016 Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
Mon Apr 25 01:27:12 +0000 2016 I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

Thu Apr 21 21:47:21 +0000 2016 Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Thu Apr 21 10:22:03 +0000 2016 Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

Sun Apr 17 13:38:31 +0000 2016 Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!

Fri Apr 01 04:23:25 +0000 2016 The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group!

Fri Mar 18 20:37:31 +0000 2016 Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!
Fri Mar 18 20:21:17 +0000 2016 Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich &amp; Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2
Fri Mar 18 20:18:14 +0000 2016 Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!

Thu Mar 17 12:28:17 +0000 2016 The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!

Tue Mar 15 11:31:46 +0000 2016 Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).
Tue Mar 15 10:39:06 +0000 2016 Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!

Tue Feb 23 14:37:10 +0000 2016 Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.

Mon Feb 22 21:11:17 +0000 2016 Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.
Mon Feb 22 21:06:25 +0000 2016 Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
Mon Feb 22 20:55:16 +0000 2016 Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
Mon Feb 22 20:50:18 +0000 2016 Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
Mon Feb 22 20:44:02 +0000 2016 Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!
Mon Feb 22 20:37:55 +0000 2016 It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.

Wed Feb 17 16:11:24 +0000 2016 Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!
Wed Feb 17 16:10:30 +0000 2016 Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @LindseyGrahamSC, and just go home.
Wed Feb 17 14:49:02 +0000 2016 .@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative!
Wed Feb 17 14:40:24 +0000 2016 I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?
Wed Feb 17 14:39:52 +0000 2016 .@lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews.
Wed Feb 17 11:08:15 +0000 2016 Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history!

Mon Feb 15 17:29:40 +0000 2016 JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician!  https://t.co/yZT3lSutt9
Mon Feb 15 17:24:53 +0000 2016 Jeb used Eminent Domain &amp; took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2) https://t.co/eiBCld77tV
Mon Feb 15 17:24:42 +0000 2016 I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue &amp; never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)
Mon Feb 15 14:04:31 +0000 2016 Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful!
Mon Feb 15 13:55:08 +0000 2016 I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Mon Feb 15 12:24:00 +0000 2016 Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada
Mon Feb 15 11:05:15 +0000 2016 Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother!
Sun Feb 14 22:02:19 +0000 2016 Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!
Sun Feb 14 21:10:20 +0000 2016 Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!
Sun Feb 14 21:07:04 +0000 2016 Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists &amp; special interests - the bosses!
Sun Feb 14 20:55:59 +0000 2016 Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors &amp; special ints

Sun Feb 14 00:11:36 +0000 2016 Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot &amp; I hold liberal positions. LIES!

Wed Feb 03 19:25:08 +0000 2016 The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!

Wed Feb 03 14:28:59 +0000 2016 Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
Wed Feb 03 14:21:03 +0000 2016 And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
Wed Feb 03 14:10:53 +0000 2016 The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
Wed Feb 03 14:07:25 +0000 2016 Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
Wed Feb 03 13:56:48 +0000 2016 During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
Wed Feb 03 13:47:33 +0000 2016 Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

Sat Jan 30 01:41:51 +0000 2016 .@oreillyfactor  The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights, as I will do for the U.S. Also got $6,000,000 for our VETS!
Sat Jan 30 01:31:51 +0000 2016 .@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS.
Sat Jan 30 01:25:17 +0000 2016 Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!
Sat Jan 30 01:15:43 +0000 2016 .@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta
Sat Jan 30 01:10:56 +0000 2016 The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.

Sat Jan 23 02:08:41 +0000 2016 Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. &amp; is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure &amp; never sold off assets.
Sat Jan 23 02:04:23 +0000 2016 Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
Sat Jan 23 01:34:26 +0000 2016 Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
Sat Jan 23 01:33:17 +0000 2016 The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!

Sat Jan 16 11:52:46 +0000 2016 Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
Sat Jan 16 11:49:02 +0000 2016 Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
Sat Jan 16 11:40:13 +0000 2016 Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
Sat Jan 16 02:47:22 +0000 2016 More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.

Sun Jan 10 23:23:07 +0000 2016 Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!
Sun Jan 10 21:06:48 +0000 2016 UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
Sun Jan 10 21:06:26 +0000 2016 This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
Sun Jan 10 21:06:07 +0000 2016 If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.

Fri Dec 11 21:49:27 +0000 2015 Tom Ridge is a failed 'Bushy' &amp; PA Governor. Him &amp; his friend @KarlRove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary- nobody listens!
Fri Dec 11 21:37:58 +0000 2015 Tom Ridge should be focused on trying to bring the party together rather than ripping it apart w/ your faulty thought process. I will win!
Fri Dec 11 21:00:20 +0000 2015 RT @tedcruz: The Establishment's only hope: Trump &amp; me in a cage match.   Sorry to disappoint -- @realDonaldTrump is terrific. #DealWithIt
Fri Dec 11 20:56:40 +0000 2015 Never get good #'s from failing Des Moines Register/Bloomberg. I think something's going on w/them. Up 13 in IA according to respected CNN.
Fri Dec 11 20:50:09 +0000 2015 Great news in Georgia!  The just out  Landmark poll shows me in first with 43%! Wow. https://t.co/mG6uZQxBWG https://t.co/UZ03GJDvOV

Fri Dec 11 13:04:16 +0000 2015 .@chucktodd is a nice guy , but just hopeless. He knows so little about politics and, in particular, winning!  I fixed his rating problem.
Fri Dec 11 12:59:25 +0000 2015 .@Morning_Joe just went off the rails. I will beat Hillary easily - she does not want to run against me. I am tuning them out, waste of time
Fri Dec 11 12:53:34 +0000 2015 .@tedcruz should not make statements behind closed doors to his bosses, he should bring them out into the open - more fun that way!
Fri Dec 11 12:49:46 +0000 2015 Looks like @tedcruz is getting ready to attack. I am leading by so much he must. I hope so, he will fall like all others. Will be easy!
Fri Dec 11 12:45:08 +0000 2015 .@Morning_Joe is so off on Iowa, which I am leading big in new @CNN poll. I will win Iowa. Also, I beat Hillary easily!
Fri Dec 11 11:34:50 +0000 2015 Great evening last night in  New Hampshire. Got the endorsement from the New England Police Union - big  territory, great people! Thank you.
