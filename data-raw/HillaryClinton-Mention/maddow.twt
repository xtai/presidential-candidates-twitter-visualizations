Sun Jan 31 04:20:38 +0000 2016 Almost impossible for me to believe that basic stuff still isn't happening, this far into Gov Rick Snyder declaring a supposed "emergency".
Sun Jan 31 04:18:01 +0000 2016 If every house in Flint needs bottled water **every day**... then there should be trucks delivering water door to door every day.  Not hard.
Sun Jan 31 04:17:24 +0000 2016 If every house in Flint needs lead testing, there should be trucks going door to door doing lead tests.  This really isn't rocket science.

Fri Jan 29 23:44:35 +0000 2016 Telling people to use filters &amp; putting water at distribution sites is an insufficient fix for a problem this big that's going on this long.
Fri Jan 29 23:41:19 +0000 2016 Reminder: Flint switched its water source *back* to its old safe source in October. These new results reflect damage done to Flint's pipes.
Fri Jan 29 23:40:21 +0000 2016 Multiple homes testing &gt;150ppb. Concerns about effectiveness of consumer-level household water filters at lead concentrations that high.
Fri Jan 29 23:39:20 +0000 2016 New lead test results just announced from Flint homes are terrible. Highest reading: 4000ppb. Federal alert level is 15ppb.

Thu Jan 28 22:46:56 +0000 2016 Flint folks I met were warm and open-hearted, but also suspicious of anyone telling them things are being taken care of. Easy to see why.
Thu Jan 28 22:41:01 +0000 2016 If you lived in Flint, who would you trust to fix the problem there now, to tell you when it's safe to give your daughter a glass of water.
Thu Jan 28 22:37:32 +0000 2016 So the Snyder Admin knows enough about the water to keep their own employees from drinking it, but tells the rest of Flint: "drink up"! (4)
Thu Jan 28 22:35:10 +0000 2016 wouldn't have to drink tap-water that the Snyder Administration said didn't "meet treatment standards". https://t.co/lfGBU9a5mC (3)

Thu Sep 18 17:41:24 +0000 2014 Today in the news: Centcom announces 176th US airstrike in Iraq, Congress announces plan to hurry home and pretend it's not happening.
