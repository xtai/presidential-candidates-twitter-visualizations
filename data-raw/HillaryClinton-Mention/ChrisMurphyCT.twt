Sat Jul 02 17:13:08 +0000 2016 So @realDonaldTrump you can oppose closing terror gap or background checks, but not on grounds that these laws are prohibited by #2A.
Sat Jul 02 17:11:16 +0000 2016 And as recently as this spring, #SCOTUS upheld Connecticut's ban on sale of assault weapons.
Sat Jul 02 17:08:58 +0000 2016 (7) Scalia SPECIFICALLY notes the constitutionality of background checks, bans on certain weapons, other conditions on commercial sales.
Sat Jul 02 17:07:01 +0000 2016 (6) But Scalia is crystal clear in Heller: "Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited."
Sat Jul 02 17:05:46 +0000 2016 (5) But 2008 changes two centuries of case law.  Heller v. DC, 217 later, reads into #2A an individual right to bear arms in 5-4 decision.
Sat Jul 02 17:04:21 +0000 2016 (4) For instance, in 1939 #SCOTUS holds #2A "does not curtail legislature’s power to regulate the nonmilitary use and ownership of weapons.”
Sat Jul 02 17:02:05 +0000 2016 (3) And for 217 years following ratification, #SCOTUS consistently held that #2A didn't include an individual right to bear arms.
Sat Jul 02 16:59:42 +0000 2016 (2) As Justice Stevens notes in Heller, it would have been easy for drafters to explicitly protect the individual right.  But they didn't.
Sat Jul 02 16:58:16 +0000 2016 (1) Madison intentionally qualified the right to bear arms as being part of the need for a well regulated militia.
Sat Jul 02 16:56:02 +0000 2016 Seems like it's time for short history of the #2A.  I promise, this will be easy, @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/spwhkaKmJ1

Thu Jun 23 19:05:06 +0000 2016 Amazing to see 200 artists incl. @PaulMcCartney @trent_reznor @ladygaga &amp; others speaking out against gun violence https://t.co/o6tUmpNyFW
Thu Jun 23 18:09:15 +0000 2016 I'm frustrated by the process, but I will keep working hard to get  this critical funding for #Zika over the finish line.
Thu Jun 23 18:08:19 +0000 2016 Cases of #Zika are on the rise &amp; those numbers will only go up. We need to stop playing games &amp; fund this urgent public health crisis

Mon Jun 20 23:01:34 +0000 2016 We have a long road ahead. But Congress cannot remain this out of step with the views &amp; values of the American people for long

Mon Jun 13 16:02:13 +0000 2016 We need to end hatred of LGBT Americans, defeat ISIS (over there and here) and keep powerful weapons away from killers. Not one, but all.
Mon Jun 13 15:58:32 +0000 2016 Those with ties to terrorists can't fly on a plane but can walk into a gun store and buy dozens of guns, hundreds of rounds of ammo. Why?
Mon Jun 13 15:57:17 +0000 2016 Assault rifles are now the weapon of choice for would-be terrorists. Why are we intentionally arming the enemy w military grade weapons?
Mon Jun 13 15:55:22 +0000 2016 ISIS, in retreat in Syria/Iraq, now depends on lone wolfs. Rhetoric/policy that marginalizes Muslims is a gift to their recruiters.
Mon Jun 13 15:53:36 +0000 2016 Laws suggesting that there is something to be feared from LGBT Americans breeds intolerance, gives license to hatred.
Mon Jun 13 15:46:01 +0000 2016 #Orlando is likely a story of a hate crime, an ISIS recruit, and an assault weapon. Thoughtful policy flows from all three, not just one.

Wed Jun 01 11:22:05 +0000 2016 Kids in Trumbull Gardens have little to do in summer. Parents have no money for summer camps, programs. Gym is a lifeline, a safe zone.

Wed May 25 20:06:01 +0000 2016 Our #mentalhealth system is broken, that much is clear. But pretending #MentalHealthReform will solve #gunviolence is simply wrong.
Wed May 25 20:04:03 +0000 2016 Making the 44 million Americans w mental illness a scapegoat for violence reinforces the idea that they should be feared instead of treated
Wed May 25 20:02:58 +0000 2016 People w serious mental illness commit &lt; 5% of all violent acts &amp; are far more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators
Wed May 25 19:58:34 +0000 2016 Does America have higher rates of mental illness than other countries? No. But unlike others, America is awash in easily accessible guns.
Wed May 25 19:48:56 +0000 2016 Happening now: I'm sharing #VoicesOfVictims of #gunviolence &amp; discussing why fixing our #mentalhealth system will not eliminate the problem

Mon May 23 20:41:29 +0000 2016 A2 We spend a lot of money on mental illness that is wasted - a siloed uncoordinated system that runs people in circles. #MentalHealthReform
Mon May 23 20:39:48 +0000 2016 Agree.  Our bill, the #MentalHealthReform Act, makes HIPAA easier for family members, patients, and providers. https://t.co/69FEaR36qh
Mon May 23 20:37:25 +0000 2016 A1 And the stigma is still there - people don't seek care bc they fear discrimination.  We can fix that.  #MentalHealthReform
Mon May 23 20:36:03 +0000 2016 A1 44 million Americans are dealing with mental illness, and resources are too thin and uncoordinated.  #MentalHealthReform
Mon May 23 20:35:05 +0000 2016 A1 Thanks for doing this @MentalHealthAm!  This is a deeply personal issue for all of us #MentalHealthReform

Mon May 23 15:08:08 +0000 2016 That's why I've introduced bipartisan legislation to reframe the US-Saudi alliance. https://t.co/nKb65MR48S
Mon May 23 15:05:40 +0000 2016 Saudis are right - there is no direct, intentional link. But Kosovo is carbon copy of what has happened in Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, etc
Mon May 23 14:56:37 +0000 2016 Why does US still largely ignore path between Saudi-funded Wahhabism and extremism?  Why do we chose to close our eyes?
Mon May 23 14:54:58 +0000 2016 Bottom line: Saudi money established Wahhabi mosques, schools that preached conservative, intolerant brand of Islam in post war Kosovo

Fri May 20 19:59:06 +0000 2016 Why did the NRA endorse Trump?  Because he doesn't care that 90% of Americans support mandatory background checks.
Fri May 20 19:57:11 +0000 2016 Why did the NRA endorse Trump?  Because he wants to ban gun free school zones. More guns in elementary schools is good for the gun lobby.
Fri May 20 19:55:54 +0000 2016 Why did the NRA endorse Trump?  Because he supports violent criminals being able to buy guns. that's great news for the gun lobby.
Fri May 20 19:54:48 +0000 2016 I have a million reasons to work day and night to beat @realDonaldTrump. But I only need one. Today, he was endorsed by the NRA.

Tue Apr 05 15:51:58 +0000 2016 And if this isn't Sanders' position - if he supports full return of liability for sellers and makers, then he should clarify immediately.
Tue Apr 05 15:50:13 +0000 2016 Democrats cannot nominate a candidate who believes that toy gun makers should be held to a higher legal standard than real gun makers.
Tue Apr 05 15:48:43 +0000 2016 For Sanders to say that the Sandy Hook families should be barred from court, even if the weapon was negligently made, is wrong.
Tue Apr 05 15:47:31 +0000 2016 Let's be clear - supporting restoring liability for sellers is not the same thing as restoring liability for gun makers.
Tue Apr 05 15:45:48 +0000 2016 Bernie is a friend, but this is really bad. Dems can't nominate a candidate who supports gun manufacturer immunity. https://t.co/JEgXQhlnAA

Wed Mar 23 14:50:51 +0000 2016 2. The EU needs a comprehensive, continent-wide, transnational counterterrorism center, with the authority to track threats across borders.

Wed Mar 23 13:11:54 +0000 2016 Point is - responses to #Brussels need to be strong, but informed by study of ISIS and what will grow/shrink their numbers.
Wed Mar 23 13:09:45 +0000 2016 Thus, narrative 2 is now critical. Attacks on the west designed to goad us into thoughtless responses that feed idea that we hate Islam.
Wed Mar 23 13:08:21 +0000 2016 Narrative 1 in jeopardy as allies take back 30-40% of territory in Iraq/Syria. If Mosul falls, a near death blow to expansion argument.
Wed Mar 23 13:06:18 +0000 2016 ISIS recruitment relies on 2 narratives: (1) inevitable expansion of caliphate and (2) Christian west at war w Muslim east.

Thu Mar 17 16:52:40 +0000 2016 The President sent us a #SCOTUS nominee. Now it's our turn to meet w him &amp; decide if he's fit for the job. That's how this works. #DoYourJob

Fri Jan 29 19:08:07 +0000 2016 (7) We don't need to blow up relationship w Saudis but the current trajectory does not protect our interests.
Fri Jan 29 19:07:51 +0000 2016 (6) US supports Saudis in Yemen. Result has been humanitarian crisis, spread of Al Qaeda and ISIS. How does that help us?
Fri Jan 29 19:07:37 +0000 2016 (5) Further, the US has little to gain In getting militarily involved in the growing Saudi-Iranian proxy war.

Fri Jan 15 02:59:18 +0000 2016 I like @marcorubio as a person. I hate the fact that he lies through his teeth - knowingly - about @POTUS wanting to confiscate guns.
Fri Jan 15 02:57:26 +0000 2016 .@marcorubio Black market guns don't grow on trees. Thousands of them come from gun shows. That's a fact.
Fri Jan 15 02:55:46 +0000 2016 Please @realDonaldTrump. If more guns made us safer, America would be the safest place on earth.
Fri Jan 15 02:53:46 +0000 2016 The law was followed in Charleston, @JebBush. And the killer still got a gun despite his criminal record.

Fri Jan 08 02:03:02 +0000 2016 Obama calling it as it is - paranoia about government coming to take your guns is, in part, a commercial play to sell more guns.

Wed Nov 11 03:50:05 +0000 2015 (4) Thus, smart anti-ISIL strategy is one part military pressure on ISIL, two parts political pressure on local populations/regimes.
Wed Nov 11 03:47:34 +0000 2015 (3) American military force can keep ISIL on its heels, but can't defeat it. Defeat is up to local populations/governments.
Wed Nov 11 03:46:05 +0000 2015 (2) Our own military leaders agree that key to ISIL growth is lack of Sunni inclusion in Shia-led regimes - political, not military vaccum.
Wed Nov 11 03:43:55 +0000 2015 (1) ISIL section of this debate is black and white - military solutions (Rubio/Bush/Fiorina/Carson) vs. no solutions at all (Trump/Paul)
Wed Nov 11 03:34:07 +0000 2015 The militarism of this debate is mind blowing. What about the last 15 years is an ad for US military solutions for the Middle East?

Thu Oct 29 17:31:54 +0000 2015 The #MentalHealthReform Act that @BillCassidy and I introduced helps tackle all of these issues. We're continuing to push it forward
Thu Oct 29 17:31:28 +0000 2015 We also need to address the fact that criminal justice system has become a stand-in for actual mental healthcare, which is unacceptable
Thu Oct 29 17:31:06 +0000 2015 Big takeaways from the hearing - we need more #mentalhealth providers, and better integration btwn behavioral &amp; physical healthcare

Mon Oct 05 17:49:57 +0000 2015 There are many ways we should be working to address #gunviolence. Clarifying our existing laws is one of them: http://t.co/K4uyOScXlT
Mon Oct 05 13:47:56 +0000 2015 Amazing that while 90% of Americans support background checks, it isn't a campaign liability for GOP.  @HillaryClinton will change that.

Fri Oct 02 17:16:41 +0000 2015 If mass shootings r proof that gun laws don't work, then it's also proof that murder laws don't work. Get rid of those too?
