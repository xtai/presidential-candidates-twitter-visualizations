Fri Aug 12 15:04:17 +0000 2016 .@usedgov didn’t fall for the scheme. To other shady #4profit schools, @JohnKingatED's right: Don’t waste your time. https://t.co/sPqrPE3HDJ
Fri Aug 12 15:03:32 +0000 2016 A Utah-based #4profit college tried to convert to a bogus nonprofit school to skirt @usedgov for-profit rules &amp; oversight. Lame trick.

Thu Aug 11 20:20:02 +0000 2016 The entire MA Congressional delegation supports @MassAGO’s enforcement of our state laws banning assault weapons. https://t.co/4ndp6414An
Thu Aug 11 19:18:43 +0000 2016 I'll keep pushing our federal agencies to reschedule marijuana as part of crafting a rational research &amp; public health strategy.
Thu Aug 11 19:17:10 +0000 2016 Bad news: @DEAHQ refused to reschedule marijuana. This has wide implications for med research, law enforcement &amp; business.
Thu Aug 11 19:16:28 +0000 2016 Good news: @DEAHQ is eliminating outdated barriers to marijuana research. Common sense given growing pool of med marijuana patients.
Wed Aug 10 16:16:15 +0000 2016 Read my op-ed w/ @SenWhitehouse on @GOP’s unprecedented attack on free speech &amp; states’ rights for big oil donors: https://t.co/gIRepwVimr
Wed Aug 10 16:15:18 +0000 2016 When oil-backed @GOP abuse power to stifle state climate change investigations, they don’t advance the 1st Amendment – they trample on it.
Tue Aug 09 17:56:18 +0000 2016 Who does the @USChamber work for? Big corps who stash profits overseas, leaving small biz to pay taxes instead. https://t.co/Tm46RYAIhC
Tue Aug 09 16:52:06 +0000 2016 More from @nytimes &amp; @TheEye_NECIR on think tank conflicts. Some can be an expert on anything for the right price. https://t.co/3t55RAI7r6
Sun Aug 07 16:55:36 +0000 2016 Read this @nytimes story on how corporations fund "independent" think tank research to push their interests: https://t.co/jcAcgljYz0
Sun Aug 07 16:54:33 +0000 2016 Big corporations must disclose lobbying expenditures, but not contributions to think tanks to fund industry-friendly studies. That’s wrong.
Fri Aug 05 16:27:26 +0000 2016 Want to protect open debate, Mr Koch? Disclose the spending you do to bury your opponents in an avalanche of lies: https://t.co/lF703sf4Hw
Fri Aug 05 16:26:34 +0000 2016 Charles Koch, who secretly spends millions to shred candidates and orgs he opposes, is worried that open debate is under attack. Really?!
Thu Aug 04 22:15:22 +0000 2016 .@HouseGOP time &amp; again puts Big Oil interests over every other issue. Proud to stand w/ @MassAGO. Let her investigate &amp; see the facts.
Thu Aug 04 22:14:51 +0000 2016 Every MA delegation member signed a letter to @LamarSmithTX21 w/ concerns about this disgraceful pander to Big Oil. https://t.co/fUl9DZ1liu
Thu Aug 04 22:07:45 +0000 2016 GOP says @MassAGO’s investigation is a war on 1st Amendment rights. But companies don’t have a right to defraud their investors &amp; consumers.
Thu Aug 04 22:06:42 +0000 2016 We haven't found another example – not one – of a House committee subpoenaing a STATE AG's investigation of potential STATE law violations.
Thu Aug 04 22:05:48 +0000 2016 The @HouseGOP claims to be for states’ rights, but they don’t seem to know the Constitution gives STATES power to enforce STATE law.
Thu Aug 04 22:04:45 +0000 2016 Sci Chairman @LamarSmithTX21 issued subpoenas to @MassAGO Healey &amp; @AGSchneiderman— a prime example of @HouseGOP abuse of power.
Thu Aug 04 22:03:48 +0000 2016 The GOP-led @HouseScience Committee is helping @exxonmobil deny the reality of climate change.
Thu Aug 04 15:46:12 +0000 2016 Today in the @NEJM I write about the need for transparency in our clinical trial system to improve people's health: https://t.co/l6hBWp53Hk
Thu Jul 21 17:23:10 +0000 2016 Yesterday @MassAGO took an important step to stop the spread of lethal assault-style weapons. Read more here: https://t.co/ElPNcmPTf5
Wed Jul 20 15:58:34 +0000 2016 Let me offer you a word of advice, @LamarSmithTX21 &amp; your @exxonmobil buddies: you picked a fight with the wrong state &amp; the wrong AG.
Wed Jul 20 15:57:19 +0000 2016 This is an outrageous abuse of Congressional subpoena power to threaten a state AG and help a campaign contributor.
Wed Jul 20 15:56:08 +0000 2016 For the @GOP, states’ rights only apply for restricting voting rights or regulating women’s bodies. Not investigating climate change fraud.
Wed Jul 20 15:54:16 +0000 2016 .@LamarSmithTX21 says he “takes very seriously his obligation to uphold &amp; defend the Constitution” — but apparently not the 10th Amendment.
Wed Jul 20 15:51:48 +0000 2016 Yup, that’s right: House Republicans are interfering with a state AG’s ongoing investigation of a company violating state law.
Wed Jul 20 15:50:42 +0000 2016 Now @exxonmobil got the Chair of the @HouseScience Committee — a TX Republican who has taken $675k from oil &amp; gas — to subpoena @MassAGO.
Wed Jul 20 15:49:43 +0000 2016 First @exxonmobil tried to stop @MassAGO by suing Healey in a TX court &amp; attacking her integrity because she’s doing her job.
Wed Jul 20 15:48:59 +0000 2016 .@MassAGO Maura Healey is investigating whether @exxonmobil broke state laws by knowingly misleading people about climate change.
Wed Jul 20 15:48:23 +0000 2016 Want to see how giant corporations rig the system? Look at what @exxonmobil is doing to intimidate @MassAGO to stop fraud investigation.
Sun Jul 17 20:30:33 +0000 2016 Heartsick for the families of the Baton Rouge police officers killed today. More violence &amp; bloodshed won't fix the pain in our country.
Thu Jul 14 22:01:46 +0000 2016 The @CFPB is proof that government CAN work for the people. #ConsumersCount https://t.co/kAUI4UG4pS
Thu Jul 14 19:25:28 +0000 2016 We need our gov agencies to work together to warn students, veterans &amp; families about other unlicensed “universities” like Trump “U.”
Thu Jul 14 19:24:36 +0000 2016 11 Senate Dems &amp; I sent a letter to @usedgov, @FTC, @CFPB &amp; @DeptVetAffairs about fake schools like Trump “U”: https://t.co/HqofUVw95d
Thu Jul 14 19:23:34 +0000 2016 Trump U violated NY law by calling itself a "university" without a charter or license. Vulnerable people lost big bucks to Trump's scheme.
Tue Jul 12 17:03:57 +0000 2016 The @HouseGOP should be ashamed. The last thing Congress should be doing is giving homophobic Americans a license to discriminate.
Tue Jul 12 17:02:23 +0000 2016 The GOP #FADA bill could let hospitals, government workers, employers, &amp; even landlords discriminate against married same-sex couples.
Tue Jul 12 17:01:34 +0000 2016 Marriage equality is the law of the land. But #LGBT Americans still lack federal protections against discrimination they desperately need.
Tue Jul 12 17:00:28 +0000 2016 I’m not joking: @HouseGOP are holding a hearing right now about making it easier for people to discriminate against #LGBT Americans.
Tue Jul 12 16:59:45 +0000 2016 Our country has seen too many tragedies this month. So what are the @HouseGOP doing right now? Holding a hearing to legalize hate.
Fri Jul 08 18:30:12 +0000 2016 I wish I had the answers right now to stop the very real pain that people are feeling, but I know this: change must come. It must come now.
Fri Jul 08 18:29:09 +0000 2016 I'm sick at heart about those who would pull us apart at exactly the moment when we need to come together.
Fri Jul 08 18:28:18 +0000 2016 I’m sick at heart for the families of the officers killed in Dallas. Sick at heart for the families of the men shot in LA &amp; MN.
Fri Jul 08 18:27:30 +0000 2016 Black Americans shouldn't be killed in routine traffic stops, &amp; police shouldn't be killed while protecting &amp; serving their communities.
Fri Jul 08 18:26:47 +0000 2016 No. No. No. No. No. More killing solves nothing. More grieving moms &amp; dads, sons &amp; daughters cannot bring back those we’ve already  lost.
Thu Jul 07 19:24:16 +0000 2016 #blacklivesmatter must be more than a hashtag or trending topic every time a tragedy happens. We must all come together to make it true.
Thu Jul 07 19:22:53 +0000 2016 We can't ignore the ugly reality: black parents are terrified that teaching kids to “survive” the police won't be enough. #blacklivesmatter
Thu Jul 07 19:22:19 +0000 2016 Most cops are good ppl. But we can’t ignore the ugly reality: black parents feel they must teach kids to “survive” police. #blacklivesmatter
Thu Jul 07 19:21:17 +0000 2016 We’ve seen the sickening videos of black Americans killed in traffic stops. Lives ended by those sworn to protect them. #blacklivesmatter
Thu Jul 07 19:20:28 +0000 2016 Sandra Bland. Freddie Gray. Michael Brown. Walter Scott. Tamir Rice. Eric Garner. Now Alton Sterling &amp; Philando Castile. #blacklivesmatter
Tue Jul 05 21:11:18 +0000 2016 Today @MarkWarner, @RepCummings &amp; I sent letters to derivative clearing orgs about resolution plans if they fail. https://t.co/ly5J2cZH5V
Wed Jun 29 20:19:44 +0000 2016 Sen @MarkWarner, @RepCummings &amp; I filed a new bill today to strengthen oversight of derivatives &amp; prevent bailouts: https://t.co/cVsxjYGsnL

Wed Jun 29 15:58:45 +0000 2016 Today, @amprog released a report on why our country needs a progressive competition policy: https://t.co/CLZtORmaZ5
Wed Jun 29 15:57:34 +0000 2016 The @rooseveltinst recently released a very thorough report on corporate, financial &amp; monopoly power: https://t.co/TkdattFbaa
Wed Jun 29 15:56:48 +0000 2016 I love strong, healthy markets – but for markets to work, we need competition. Consolidation &amp; concentration are on the rise.
Tue Jun 28 19:46:38 +0000 2016 #Zika isn't just coming. It's here. If the GOP won’t take it seriously, they must accept responsibility for the devastating consequences.
Tue Jun 28 19:45:46 +0000 2016 Every day @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP don't take #Zika seriously, more ppl get sick. 481 pregnant women in US states &amp; territories have Zika NOW.
Tue Jun 28 19:44:36 +0000 2016 Is this some sort of sick joke, @SenateGOP? Is the #Zika virus — and our country’s response to this emergency — just a game to you?!
Tue Jun 28 19:43:39 +0000 2016 I didn’t think the GOP could write 1 bill to hurt women, vets, Obamacare, PP, AND clean water all at once – but they did it. #Zika
Tue Jun 28 19:42:53 +0000 2016 The GOP #Zika bill cuts Senate levels of @DeptVetAffairs funding by $500M – money for VA hospital maintenance &amp; raises for doctors &amp; nurses.
Tue Jun 28 19:42:04 +0000 2016 The GOP #Zika bill rolls back Clean Water Act requirements designed to keep pesticides out of Americans’ drinking water.
Tue Jun 28 19:41:14 +0000 2016 The GOP #Zika bill blocks @PPFA from receiving birth control grant money that would help poor women with Zika avoid having deformed babies.
Tue Jun 28 19:40:28 +0000 2016 The GOP #Zika bill guts money from healthcare exchanges in the Affordable Care Act (#obamacare) to pay for the emergency response.
Tue Jun 28 19:39:53 +0000 2016 The GOP #Zika bill steals money from the #Ebola response fund, even though we still have 75 CDC staff on ground fighting the outbreak.
Tue Jun 28 19:39:08 +0000 2016 The GOP #Zika bill provides $800 million less in funding than the @WhiteHouse requested. Money we need for prevention &amp; treatment.
Tue Jun 28 19:38:15 +0000 2016 Then while @HouseDemocrats fought for gun violence votes at #NoBillNoBreak, the @HouseGOP jammed through a terrible #Zika bill at 3am.
Tue Jun 28 19:37:19 +0000 2016 4 months ago, the @WhiteHouse requested $1.9B to fight #Zika. Dems asked the GOP to act – and the GOP dragged their feet.
Tue Jun 28 19:36:40 +0000 2016 My blood is boiling over the pathetic, dishonest &amp; malicious #Zika funding bill that @SenateMajLdr McConnell &amp; the GOP just tried to pass.
Thu Jun 23 01:45:51 +0000 2016 .@SpeakerRyan &amp; the @HouseGOP: You should be ashamed of yourselves for your totally corrupt priorities. People are watching.
Thu Jun 23 01:44:29 +0000 2016 .@HouseDemocrats: Please vote NO on this veto override. We weren’t sent here to do dirty work for Wall St’s armies of lawyers &amp; lobbyists.
Thu Jun 23 01:42:56 +0000 2016 When @SpeakerRyan turns off the cameras, the @HouseGOP gets to work — both for the @NRA AND for Wall Street. Unbelievable.
Thu Jun 23 01:41:58 +0000 2016 .@SpeakerRyan scheduled a vote tonight to kill a new @USDOL rule that protects workers’ retirement savings from shady financial advisers.
Thu Jun 23 01:40:20 +0000 2016 After a whole day of #NoBillNoBreak, @HouseGOP is instead moving on a vote to make it easier for retirement advisers to cheat ppl. Really.
Thu Jun 23 00:53:48 +0000 2016 Sorry about blocking the livestream for a sec there! Just happy to see my friend @RepDuckworth at #NoBillNoBreak. https://t.co/rKjyWGrgGe

Wed Jun 22 17:58:35 +0000 2016 Hero @repjohnlewis is leading a sit-in on gun violence &amp; @SpeakerRyan shut off the camera so you can’t watch. Shameful. #NoBillNoBreak
Tue Jun 21 22:06:50 +0000 2016 .@HouseDemocrats must continue to stand strong against these @GOP efforts to help Wall Street at the expense of working families.
Tue Jun 21 22:05:45 +0000 2016 The @HouseGOP bill weakens the @CFPB, delays payday lending &amp; forced arbitration clause rules, undermines regulators &amp; cuts SEC funding.
Tue Jun 21 22:04:10 +0000 2016 Next up on the @HouseGOP’s agenda to help Wall Street: A vote on a gov funding bill chock-full of items on the big banks’ wish list.
Tue Jun 21 17:55:30 +0000 2016 After Orlando, @US_FDA should implement a risk-based blood donor policy that doesn't discriminate against LGBT men. https://t.co/ThrpkBIAEf
Mon Jun 20 23:08:01 +0000 2016 .@ChrisMurphyCT said it right: The @SenateGOP have decided to sell weapons to ISIS.
Mon Jun 20 23:06:42 +0000 2016 Ashamed &amp; disgusted that the Senate works for the @NRA &amp; not the majority of Americans who support basic solutions to stop gun violence.
Mon Jun 20 21:10:35 +0000 2016 These common-sense gun reforms are THE VERY LEAST we can do to help keep our loved ones safe. #DisarmHate
Mon Jun 20 21:09:33 +0000 2016 Back in DC &amp; ready to vote to #disarmhate by expanding background checks &amp; stopping terrorists from buying guns. https://t.co/OUWg4K1Az2

Wed Jun 15 23:57:24 +0000 2016 We can make it harder for terrorism to take root in our country. We can drive forces of hate out of our nation. #filibuster #holdthefloor
Wed Jun 15 23:56:48 +0000 2016 We can keep Rambo-style assault weapons out of the hands of those who would do us harm. #filibuster #holdthefloor
Wed Jun 15 23:56:12 +0000 2016 We cannot miss: It was a terrorist with hate in his heart &amp; a gun in his hand who killed all those people. #filibuster #holdthefloor
Wed Jun 15 23:55:45 +0000 2016 But it was the patriots at Stonewall who showed us that change is possible. Love can triumph over hate &amp; fear. #filibuster #holdthefloor

Thu Jun 09 16:55:27 +0000 2016 #WethePeople Act reverses Citizens United, closes the revolving door between gov &amp; Wall St, boosts disclosure, &amp; strengthens lobbying rules.
Thu Jun 09 16:54:13 +0000 2016 That’s why I’m joining my fellow @SenateDems today to introduce the #WethePeople Act. https://t.co/Qs5iTUueav
Thu Jun 09 16:53:06 +0000 2016 Government should be accountable to the people, not Wall Street lobbyists, deep-pocketed donors, and secretive Super PACs.
Wed Jun 08 21:55:12 +0000 2016 The American people deserve better than @SenateMajLdr &amp; the @SenateGOP’s judicial blockade. Watch: https://t.co/YWzxaZ9c8e #DoYourJob
Wed Jun 08 21:54:13 +0000 2016 I wish I could say I’m surprised, but @SenateMajLdr &amp; @SenateGOP keep court seats empty as long as possible to hamstring @POTUS.
Wed Jun 08 21:53:24 +0000 2016 I called for immediate votes on 15 judicial nominees. @SenateMajLdr objected. 9 nominees? No. 4 nominees? No. Just 1 nominee? No.
Wed Jun 08 21:52:35 +0000 2016 I took @SenateGOP's deal: 2 other judges confirmed if I’d keep quiet. Then today I went back to the floor to call for votes on the 15.
Wed Jun 08 21:51:39 +0000 2016 I wanted to request votes for the 15 District Court noms on Monday – but @SenateMajLdr didn’t want to be embarrassed so he cut me a deal.
Wed Jun 08 21:50:47 +0000 2016 The @senjudiciary Committee has cleared 15 nominees for federal District Courts. Those nominees are still waiting for confirmation votes.
Tue Jun 07 18:25:43 +0000 2016 Read my op-ed with @SenSchumer &amp; @SenWhitehouse opposing SS trustee nominee Blahous &amp; SEC nominee Peirce: https://t.co/lSAUyjR88Y
Tue Jun 07 18:24:27 +0000 2016 The Kochs’ purpose is clear: To tilt the game further for corporate special interests. It’s up to us to fight back.
Tue Jun 07 18:23:52 +0000 2016 The Koch Brothers are dumping enormous resources into grooming &amp; bankrolling anti-gov zealots for top gov positions.
Tue Jun 07 16:34:49 +0000 2016 A marriage between @realDonaldTrump’s toxic racism &amp; @RepHensarling’s Wall Street giveaways is a path to ruin for our country.
Tue Jun 07 16:33:40 +0000 2016 In fact, @RepHensarling met with @realDonaldTrump today to pitch him on his new plan to gut Wall St reform – including the @CFPB.
Tue Jun 07 16:32:47 +0000 2016 Today in the Banking Committee I spoke about @RepHensarling’s new bill I call the Wet Kiss for Wall Street Act. https://t.co/qCTweAI770
Mon Jun 06 17:59:14 +0000 2016 .@SenateGOP: Have a hearing and a vote on #SCOTUS nominee Merrick Garland. Ditch the extremism and #DoYourJob.
Mon Jun 06 17:58:13 +0000 2016 The GOP says if gov isn’t working for them &amp; their rich buddies, they won’t let it work for anyone. That extremism got us @realDonaldTrump.
Mon Jun 06 17:55:50 +0000 2016 .@SenateGOP obstruct @POTUS's nominees just because they don’t like the guy doing the nominating. Read my report: https://t.co/MfZfye5qVM
Mon Jun 06 17:54:41 +0000 2016 Gov is supposed to work for all of us. But when it comes to making sure courts &amp; watchdogs are staffed, @SenateGOP refuse to do their jobs.
Thu Jun 02 14:40:28 +0000 2016 Congress wasn’t elected to help predatory lenders. If anyone tries to block or delay the @CFPB payday rules, it’s time to fight back hard.
Thu Jun 02 14:39:14 +0000 2016 Payday lending is a $7B/yr industry. That buys a lot of influence in Congress – not just with the GOP, but also some Democrats.
Thu Jun 02 14:37:53 +0000 2016 The proposed payday lending rule isn’t perfect – it could do more – but the payday industry is already firing back.
Thu Jun 02 14:36:44 +0000 2016 The @CFPB’s new rule cracks down on tricks payday lenders use to generate thousands in interest &amp; fees from ppl trapped in cycles of debt.
Thu Jun 02 14:35:47 +0000 2016 It’s another good day: The @CFPB just took a big step to protect consumers from predatory payday loans. https://t.co/KtnxEk4F1E
Wed May 25 22:42:55 +0000 2016 We’ll gear up &amp; fight back, like we’ve done so many times before. We won’t let the @CFPB be destroyed by Wall St &amp; their Washington friends.
Wed May 25 22:40:59 +0000 2016 The @CFPB has handled 900k complaints &amp; forced big banks to return $11B to people they cheated. @HouseGOP can’t stand gov that works.
Wed May 25 22:39:32 +0000 2016 .@HouseAppropsGOP voted today to hamstring the @CFPB &amp; make it tougher for the cops on Wall Street to do their jobs.
Wed May 25 21:02:53 +0000 2016 Student loans make it tough for ppl to buy homes. Thrilled @nardotrealtor supports my #bankonstudents refi bill. https://t.co/HbGNXlhi6r

Tue May 24 14:24:19 +0000 2016 Yesterday I reminded the @SenateGOP: We weren’t sent here to work for Wall Street &amp; their armies of lawyers &amp; lobbyists.
Tue May 24 14:23:25 +0000 2016 Today the @SenateGOP is voting for a proposal to make it EASIER for Wall Street to cheat Americans out of the retirement savings.
Mon May 23 19:10:32 +0000 2016 This @BostonGlobe story shows that the student debt crisis is real – and it's even worse than we imagined. https://t.co/o5A0bzg21E

Thu May 19 20:02:27 +0000 2016 Change won’t be easy – but we don’t get what we don’t fight for. America’s workers are worth fighting for. #itspersonal
Thu May 19 19:59:45 +0000 2016 Most workers aren’t asking for the moon. They just want some security. That’s America's promise, but not without real changes. #itspersonal

Wed May 18 17:58:30 +0000 2016 Read my office’s report on how @USDOL’s new overtime rule will make a big difference for working families: https://t.co/R28FjGtX0f
Wed May 18 17:57:50 +0000 2016 When these OT changes take effect in December, millions will have a fighting chance to build more financial security. That’s a big deal!
Wed May 18 17:57:09 +0000 2016 Big companies &amp; trade associations flooded @USDOL with criticism of this overtime change, but workers spoke up too — and @USDOL listened.
Wed May 18 17:55:38 +0000 2016 .@USDOL’s new overtime rule guarantees anyone earning less than $47,476/yr will qualify for OT — nearly 40% of full-time salaried workers.
Wed May 18 17:55:00 +0000 2016 Anyone who puts in a hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay. Today @USDOL released an overtime pay rule that helps make that happen.
Tue May 17 18:24:50 +0000 2016 #Zika is coming, &amp; if the @SenateGOP blocks Congress from protecting people, they must accept responsibility for devastating consequences.
Tue May 17 18:23:54 +0000 2016 We cannot nickel-and-dime the #Zika health emergency response. That’s not how science works. Watch: https://t.co/GUkrFigRfA
Tue May 17 18:22:19 +0000 2016 Here’s the bottom line: The less money Congress gives doctors, scientists &amp; public health officials, the more people will be hurt by #Zika.
Tue May 17 18:21:26 +0000 2016 Most @SenateGOP still oppose fully funding #Zika response &amp; want to gut our public health infrastructure to say they're tough on spending.
Tue May 17 18:20:39 +0000 2016 Months after @POTUS requested nearly $2B to fight #Zika, the @SenateGOP will finally let us vote on funding options today.

Thu May 12 17:48:40 +0000 2016 .@RepJohnConyers &amp; I, &amp; 100+ Congress members, sent a letter to Fed Chair Yellen about the Fed’s diversity problem: https://t.co/lRHP7Fw4Kp
Thu May 12 17:46:39 +0000 2016 I appreciate @RepJohnConyers' leadership on this letter, and his long record of leadership on civil rights and diversity issues.
Thu May 12 17:44:31 +0000 2016 Unemployment is 4% for white Americans. It’s 9% for African-Americans. Economic recovery has never fully reached Black &amp; Latino communities.
Thu May 12 17:43:52 +0000 2016 A lack of diverse leadership is hurting the @FederalReserve’s policy decision-making process. https://t.co/LZO88IOfyN

Mon May 02 18:17:42 +0000 2016 If we raise the overtime threshold, millions of people – including 281k in MA – will qualify for OT. #overdueOT https://t.co/QZHWaogdW9

Thu Apr 21 15:11:56 +0000 2016 Read my letter to Chair Mary Jo White about my serious concerns with the SEC: https://t.co/8CHbzCAIpH
Thu Apr 21 15:11:30 +0000 2016 This decision is a mockery of the SEC's core mission &amp; the latest example of the SEC failing to punish guilty parties &amp; protect investors.
Thu Apr 21 15:11:05 +0000 2016 Just 2 months after Cohen's sanction, the SEC approved the application of a new investment firm co-owned by… Steven Cohen. Seriously.
Thu Apr 21 15:10:40 +0000 2016 SAC Capital pled guilty to insider trading in 2013. In Jan, the SEC barred its manager Steven Cohen from managing outside funds until 2018.

Thu Apr 14 21:16:13 +0000 2016 “Unbelievable”? Yes, totally unbelievable that JPM could get tagged as TBTF &amp; then pat each other on the backs &amp; say “heckuva job.”

Wed Apr 13 21:00:08 +0000 2016 Today, our top regulators warned us about the danger of the biggest banks. We would be foolish to ignore their warnings.
Wed Apr 13 20:59:36 +0000 2016 This is a giant warning sign of the central role big banks will play in the next crisis unless Congress &amp; regulators show some backbone.
Wed Apr 13 20:58:53 +0000 2016 No execs lost their jobs in exchange for taxpayer rescue. None went to jail. Some, like Jamie Dimon, are still running the same banks.
Wed Apr 13 20:58:07 +0000 2016 Big bank execs got rich but when it all predictably blew up, the gov lavished their institutions with billions in bailouts.
Wed Apr 13 20:57:29 +0000 2016 The big banks spread risk throughout the system by misleading investors about the quality of mortgages in the securities they were offering.
Wed Apr 13 20:56:46 +0000 2016 There would be no crisis without these giant banks that encouraged reckless mortgage lending &amp; funded slimy subprime lenders.
Wed Apr 13 20:56:12 +0000 2016 Wall St lobbyists have tried to deflect blame for the 2008 crisis for years. But their revisionist history is untrue &amp; dangerous.
Wed Apr 13 20:55:34 +0000 2016 Unless the banks promptly address regulators’ concerns, the gov must push these banks to get smaller &amp; less complex.
Wed Apr 13 20:54:45 +0000 2016 5 US banks are big enough that any one could crash the economy again if they failed &amp; weren’t bailed out. It’s a very big deal. It’s scary.
Wed Apr 13 20:54:10 +0000 2016 Today, after an extensive review, fed regulators concluded that 5 of the biggest banks are still Too Big to Fail. https://t.co/zZNeA8HjrN
Wed Apr 13 18:40:43 +0000 2016 The Tax Filing Simplification Act is a commonsense bill to push the IRS to simplify Tax Day. Learn more: https://t.co/knv4GUBu8G
Wed Apr 13 18:40:19 +0000 2016 And the Tax Filing Simplification Act provides a return-free option for those with simple tax situations.
Wed Apr 13 18:39:52 +0000 2016 The Tax Filing Simplification Act lets taxpayers download third-party-reported tax information that the IRS already has.
Wed Apr 13 18:39:28 +0000 2016 It prohibits the IRS from entering into agreements w/ tax prep companies that restrict its ability to provide free online services.
Wed Apr 13 18:39:07 +0000 2016 My bill directs the IRS to develop a free, online tax prep &amp; filing service that taxpayers can use directly w/ the gov.
Wed Apr 13 18:38:42 +0000 2016 Today I introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act to help taxpayers file with less stress &amp; fewer costs.
Wed Apr 13 18:38:06 +0000 2016 Congress should be making it easier for Americans to file their taxes, not bowing to the interests of the tax prep industry.
Wed Apr 13 18:37:47 +0000 2016 This year, taxpayers will spend an average of 13 hrs prepping taxes &amp; pay $200 for tax prep services.
Wed Apr 13 15:32:42 +0000 2016 Read my office’s new report on how the IRS caved to powerful companies w/ a vested interest in complicated taxes: https://t.co/wXXrLh60T7
Wed Apr 13 15:32:15 +0000 2016 That means taxpayers have to spend billions – and share personal info with 3rd-parties – just to file taxes.
Wed Apr 13 15:32:03 +0000 2016 The tax prep industry has fought zealously to block the IRS from implementing laws to make tax prep &amp; filing easier.
Tue Apr 12 20:52:08 +0000 2016 We recognize #EqualPayDay - &amp; we fight so we don’t have to recognize it again. Watch: https://t.co/1zwmmY1oFp

Tue Apr 05 17:38:35 +0000 2016 The bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Comm said this "pivotal failure" was a "prime example" of how regulators let the meltdown happen.
Tue Apr 05 17:38:04 +0000 2016 One witness had led the Fed division that refused to regulate deceptive mortgages, including subprime lending that helped spark the crisis.

Wed Mar 30 15:53:30 +0000 2016 It’s past time for @usedgov’s bank to start running the student loan program to benefit students, not companies like Navient. #studentdebt
Wed Mar 30 15:53:09 +0000 2016 Instead of holding Navient accountable, @usedgov’s student loan bank covered for them. Outrageous, but not surprising. #studentdebt
Wed Mar 30 15:52:43 +0000 2016 Navient, one of the biggest student loan servicers, got caught cheating American soldiers on student loans. #studentdebt

Mon Mar 14 23:06:49 +0000 2016 .@JohnKingatED didn’t create these problems at @usedgov – but he has a lot of work to do to get the Dept’s higher ed house in order.
Mon Mar 14 23:06:21 +0000 2016 Secretary of Ed is one of the toughest jobs, because for yrs @usedgov has put student loan companies &amp; for-profit colleges before students.
Mon Mar 14 23:05:53 +0000 2016 The Senate just voted to confirm @JohnKingatED to be the next Secretary of Education – one of the most important jobs in DC.

Wed Mar 09 21:26:11 +0000 2016 .@Senate_GOPs want to play it both ways: rejecting @POTUS’s legitimacy and crippling the govt while claiming Rs can govern responsibly.
Wed Mar 09 21:25:47 +0000 2016 At the same time they’re blocking any SCOTUS nominee, @Senate_GOPs are in a panic that their party will nominate an extremist for President.

Fri Mar 04 20:04:09 +0000 2016 The @CFPB is doing a great job to crack down on the tricks &amp; traps in payday loans. Congress should back the @CFPB, not sabotage it.
Fri Mar 04 20:03:42 +0000 2016 Until the @CFPB, no federal agency was responsible for overseeing payday lenders, who can stick vulnerable people with rates up to 400%.
Fri Mar 04 20:03:19 +0000 2016 2.5 million households borrow from payday lenders each year, with more storefronts in the US than McDonald’s and Starbucks combined.

Thu Feb 25 21:22:32 +0000 2016 The @CFTC committee’s report is little more than a recitation of industry talking points and should be treated as such.
Thu Feb 25 21:22:10 +0000 2016 The @CFTC report is riddled w/ problems &amp; mischaracterizations, &amp; adopted without public discussion or public vote.
Thu Feb 25 21:21:25 +0000 2016 The advisory committee behind this compromised @CFTC report consists almost entire of industry insiders – violating Dodd-Frank.
Thu Feb 25 21:21:04 +0000 2016 Today that advisory committee presented a final report that is critical of the @CFTC’s proposed rule on commodities futures &amp; swaps.
Thu Feb 25 21:20:41 +0000 2016 Under Dodd-Frank, Congress directed the @CFTC to establish the EEMAC – an advisory committee for diverse views on CFTC actions.

Thu Feb 25 16:45:58 +0000 2016 Serious medical research on medical marijuana is largely blocked by outdated federal laws &amp; policies.
Thu Feb 25 16:45:44 +0000 2016 Medical marijuana might be a viable alternative to opioids for pain treatment, but truthfully, there's a lot we just don't know.

Sun Feb 14 14:45:27 +0000 2016 Abandoning their Senate duties would also prove that all the Republican talk about loving the Constitution is just that – empty talk.
Sun Feb 14 14:45:05 +0000 2016 The Senate GOP took an oath just like Dems did. Abandoning the duties they swore to uphold threatens the Constitution &amp; our democracy.
Sun Feb 14 14:44:47 +0000 2016 I can’t find a clause in the Constitution that says “…except when there’s a year left in the term of a Democratic President.”
Sun Feb 14 14:44:36 +0000 2016 Art II Sec 2 of the Constitution says the President nominates Supreme Court justices with the advice &amp; consent of the Senate.
Sun Feb 14 14:44:16 +0000 2016 .@SenateMajLdr is right that Americans should have a voice in selecting the next SCOTUS justice. In fact, they did: when @POTUS won in 2012.
Sun Feb 14 14:44:00 +0000 2016 The sudden death of Justice Scalia creates an immediate vacancy on the most important court in the United States.
Thu Feb 11 19:44:06 +0000 2016 .@RepCummings &amp; I sent a letter to @USDOL about advisors’ wildly conflicting messages on a conflict of interest rule https://t.co/U7y9ZoFrxi
Thu Feb 11 19:42:59 +0000 2016 But when these retirement advisors talk to their own stockholders, the doomsday predictions disappear &amp; the companies say they’ll be fine.
Thu Feb 11 19:42:41 +0000 2016 Financial companies have predicted dire consequences from a new rule requiring them to act in customers’ best interests.
Tue Feb 09 19:53:59 +0000 2016 I won't support more "innovation" proposals until we have a bipartisan agreement to strengthen @US_FDA &amp; seriously fund medical research.
Tue Feb 09 19:53:36 +0000 2016 Watch my remarks to the HELP Committee today on why Congress needs to commit to funding medical research: https://t.co/mq25Z1DOAX
Tue Feb 09 19:53:21 +0000 2016 Heading into an election, it'd be easy for Congress to pass some small bills, declare victory &amp; quit. But that's not good enough.
Tue Feb 09 19:53:01 +0000 2016 Last yr, @newtgingrich said ignoring this NIH funding problem “takes a special kind of stupidity that is reserved for this city.” I agree.
Tue Feb 09 19:52:41 +0000 2016 Big medical breakthroughs come from basic research. Instead of funding that research, Congress has spent a decade choking off support.
Tue Feb 09 19:52:25 +0000 2016 The Senate HELP Committee approved bills today to advance US medical innovation. I voted for those bills - but it isn't enough.
Fri Feb 05 19:11:33 +0000 2016 On #FMLA23, we remember how much more we need to do to level the playing field for workers &amp; families. https://t.co/JRqeMniImE

Thu Feb 04 20:56:20 +0000 2016 If we want strong enforcement, personnel is policy. Read Commissioner Bowen’s call for tougher Wall St enforcement: https://t.co/sm3QxIsEFA
Thu Feb 04 19:22:42 +0000 2016 Every single House Republican who came to work today just voted to make it harder to hold big banks accountable for fraud. Shameful.
Thu Feb 04 15:59:22 +0000 2016 Tell Congress: They work for the American people — not Wall Street banks that break the law. Vote NO on HR 766.
Thu Feb 04 15:58:57 +0000 2016 You read that right: The House is just minutes away from voting on a bill to make it tougher to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.
Thu Feb 04 15:58:39 +0000 2016 Nope — right now on the House floor, Wall St buddies are pushing a bill to make it tougher to prosecute bank fraud.
Thu Feb 04 15:58:21 +0000 2016 You’d think big banks would be happy with enforcement so tepid that they could just bake fines into the cost of doing business, right?
Thu Feb 04 15:58:04 +0000 2016 Systematic fraud on Wall St helped spark the 2008 financial crisis – but not a single Wall St executive went to jail.
Wed Feb 03 18:26:40 +0000 2016 If anyone in Congress thinks they can make it harder to crack down on corporate criminals, I promise you: The American people are watching.
Wed Feb 03 18:26:10 +0000 2016 Today I spoke on the Senate floor about our rigged justice system for the rich &amp; powerful. Watch: https://t.co/NWX8Et2hqA
Wed Feb 03 18:25:09 +0000 2016 The American people remember who broke our economy &amp; who made out like bandits – and they didn’t send us here to help the bandits.
Wed Feb 03 18:24:44 +0000 2016 Want to see the rigged game in action? Tomorrow, the House will vote on a GOP bill to make it harder to investigate &amp; prosecute bank fraud.
Wed Feb 03 18:24:23 +0000 2016 It’s not equal justice when a kid gets thrown in jail for stealing a car, while a CEO gets a huge raise when his company steals billions.
Wed Feb 03 18:24:02 +0000 2016 We have one set of law on the books, but two legal systems: One for the rich &amp; powerful, and one for everyone else.
Wed Feb 03 15:06:24 +0000 2016 Heading to the Senate floor now to discuss my enforcement report &amp; GOP efforts to weaken Wall St accountability: https://t.co/fbMGC9EVjR
Wed Feb 03 00:24:34 +0000 2016 Today I urged Congress to reject the #TPP deal before it makes things even worse for America’s families: https://t.co/h339ZKInfy
Wed Feb 03 00:24:00 +0000 2016 Congress will have to vote straight up or down on #TPP.  We won’t have a chance to strip out any of the worst provisions, like ISDS.
Wed Feb 03 00:23:40 +0000 2016 A rigged process produces a rigged outcome. Evidence of this tilt can be seen in a key #TPP provision: ISDS.
Wed Feb 03 00:23:04 +0000 2016 12 countries will sign the #TPP trade deal on Thursday - but it won't go into effect unless Congress approves it.
Mon Feb 01 22:51:40 +0000 2016 Today I asked the Senate GOP: If you won't support #InTheRed, then what's your plan for student loan debt? https://t.co/kIjPpgSgRy
Mon Feb 01 20:00:36 +0000 2016 Thanks everyone for coming to our Springfield open house today! I'm happy to fight for Western MA in the Senate. https://t.co/g90P757ZaG
Fri Jan 29 15:44:21 +0000 2016 The next president can honor the simple notion that nobody is above the law, but it will happen only if voters demand it.
Fri Jan 29 15:43:44 +0000 2016 Read my new @nytimes op-ed about how personnel is policy for enforcing federal laws: https://t.co/BZZSpjm7VS
Fri Jan 29 15:43:15 +0000 2016 Today my office released a report on 20 of the worst federal enforcement failures in 2015: https://t.co/u0R2JX1BNd
Fri Jan 29 15:42:42 +0000 2016 Presidents don’t control most day-to-day enforcement decisions, but they do nominate heads of agencies. That makes all the difference.
Fri Jan 29 15:42:24 +0000 2016 Much of the attention on DC focuses on enacting laws, but a law that's not enforced may as well not even be a law at all.
Fri Jan 29 15:42:10 +0000 2016 2016 candidates are pitching their legislative agendas, but voters should consider what presidents can do without Congress.

Thu Jan 21 20:37:12 +0000 2016 This Congress doesn’t lack workable ideas for how to root out the influence of money in politics; it just lacks the spine to do them.
Thu Jan 21 20:36:56 +0000 2016 Here’s a whole list of things Congress could do if we had the courage to stand up to the super-wealthy few: https://t.co/xjGe3EzdgA
Thu Jan 21 20:36:19 +0000 2016 We can – and we should – blame the Supreme Court for #CitizensUnited. But that is no excuse for doing nothing.
