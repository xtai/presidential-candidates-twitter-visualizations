Thu Aug 11 18:58:25 +0000 2016 Join Dems in calling on @SpeakerRyan &amp; @SenateMajLdr to bring back Congress to pass a clean #Zika bill: https://t.co/DkiLuDQtCA
Thu Aug 11 18:56:56 +0000 2016 Every day the GOP stalls funding #Zika response, more people get sick. More babies risk being born with heartbreaking head deformities.
Thu Aug 11 18:55:47 +0000 2016 When a reporter asked @SenateMajLdr why he wouldn’t pass a clean #Zika bill, he said that’s just the way things are done in Washington.
Thu Aug 11 18:54:28 +0000 2016 I didn’t think the @HouseGOP could pass 1 bill to hurt women, vets, Obamacare, @PPFA &amp; clean water all at once, but their #Zika bill did it.
Thu Aug 11 18:53:22 +0000 2016 The last @HouseGOP #Zika bill – jammed thru at 3am during #nobillnobreak – was a pathetic, dishonest, malicious bill loaded w/ poison pills.
Thu Aug 11 18:52:17 +0000 2016 #Zika is a public health emergency, but the @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP have no plans to do anything before Labor Day.
Wed Aug 10 03:43:21 +0000 2016 Woo-hoo! Congrats to Needham's own @Aly_Raisman &amp; the entire @USAGym women's team! We're so proud of you! #USA #Rio2016
Tue Aug 09 21:53:14 +0000 2016 Your reckless comments sound like a two-bit dictator, @realDonaldTrump. Not a man who wants to lead the greatest democracy on the planet.
Tue Aug 09 21:51:44 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump makes death threats because he's a pathetic coward who can’t handle the fact that he’s losing to a girl.
Mon Aug 08 20:04:52 +0000 2016 The American people aren’t dumb, @realDonaldTrump. We don’t trust you with our nuclear codes AND we don’t trust you with our economy.
Mon Aug 08 20:03:20 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump's economics plan is all about helping rich guys like Donald Trump get richer – &amp; leaving everyone else behind.
Mon Aug 08 20:01:44 +0000 2016 Even @realDonaldTrump's childcare plan gives billionaires w/ a nanny a tax break while millions of low-income households get nothing.
Mon Aug 08 19:59:37 +0000 2016 And taxes? @realDonaldTrump wants billionaires &amp; giant corps to pay EVEN LESS – so there’s less money for ed, infrastructure &amp; research.
Mon Aug 08 19:58:03 +0000 2016 Cheating customers &amp; gaming the system might be your business, @realDonaldTrump, but it’s not the way America is going to do business.
Mon Aug 08 19:56:21 +0000 2016 Trump gets advice from Bear Stearns' fmr chief economist. So @realDonaldTrump: did BS need FEWER regs when they helped crash our economy?
Mon Aug 08 19:54:41 +0000 2016 W/o rules, @realDonaldTrump, too many huge banks juiced profits by cheating ppl on mortgages, credit cards, etc, then crashed our economy.
Mon Aug 08 19:52:53 +0000 2016 A “moratorium” on agency regulations means stopping new rules on shady payday lenders &amp; too-big-to-fail banks, @realDonaldTrump.
Mon Aug 08 19:51:23 +0000 2016 “Cut regulations massively,” @realDonaldTrump? No rules &amp; no accountability means people get ripped off &amp; markets blow up. Remember 2008?
Mon Aug 08 19:50:05 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump's econ plan was written by rich corporate insider advisors to make the economy even greater for rich corporate insiders.

Sat Jul 23 23:22:21 +0000 2016 Today I told #NCLR16 that we’ll never build Trump’s stupid wall, &amp; we must elect @HillaryClinton &amp; @timkaine in Nov. https://t.co/96yVSlXUsS
Sat Jul 23 23:21:04 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump? He cheered on the 2008 housing crisis so he could scoop up real estate on the cheap. Trump thinks only about himself.
Sat Jul 23 23:19:46 +0000 2016 .@timkaine started his career helping families fight housing discrimination. That’s because Tim has always had a good heart.
Sat Jul 23 23:18:20 +0000 2016 During the 2008 crash, Latino families were 71% more likely to lose their homes. Lenders paid millions in fines for this “racial surtax.”
Sat Jul 23 20:36:52 +0000 2016 This week I joined @POTUS for his weekly @WhiteHouse radio address to celebrate the 5th anniv of the @CFPB. Woo-hoo! https://t.co/IQayBAY8li
Sat Jul 23 18:41:40 +0000 2016 In just a few minutes I'll be talking to #NCLR16 about why we must defeat @realDonaldTrump. Watch live: https://t.co/fjw5Ag0YFo #LatinosVote
Sat Jul 23 14:46:16 +0000 2016 I hope you catch my speech at #NCLR16 in Orlando today, @realDonaldTrump. I don't think you'll like it. #LatinosVote
Sat Jul 23 14:43:53 +0000 2016 I’m right where I want to be, @realDonaldTrump: Calling you out &amp; holding you responsible for your reckless vision for America.
Fri Jul 22 03:11:00 +0000 2016 Don't forget: Tonight I'll be talking about @realDonaldTrump's speech live on @colbertlateshow. Tune in.  #ColbertRNC #lssc #RNCinCLE
Thu Jul 21 21:41:24 +0000 2016 The @CFPB has forced the big banks to return $11.7B directly to people who have been cheated. That's gov that works for the people!
Thu Jul 21 21:39:14 +0000 2016 The financial industry HATED the @CFPB, but we fought back &amp; won. Today we celebrate the 5-yr anniv of that little agency opening its doors.
Thu Jul 21 21:38:19 +0000 2016 One thing we definitely got right in Dodd-Frank was the @CFPB. Wall St can't cheat people on mortgages, credit cards &amp; student loans.
Thu Jul 21 21:37:25 +0000 2016 Dodd-Frank wasn’t perfect – we still have more work to do to make sure the big banks don’t bring down our economy again.
Thu Jul 21 21:36:23 +0000 2016 6 yrs ago today, @BarackObama signed Dodd-Frank, the Wall St reform bill that was a powerful step towards holding the big banks accountable.
Thu Jul 21 15:25:21 +0000 2016 Want to know what I think of Trump's speech tonight? Stay up for @colbertlateshow to find out. #colbertRNC #lssc https://t.co/DMJjcPIsHp
Tue Jul 19 20:05:54 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump models himself on an insecure narcissist whose lies &amp; schemes embarrassed our country. Figures. https://t.co/iomx2ZXXQ1
Sun Jul 17 14:38:30 +0000 2016 You’re nothing but a thin-skinned bully and a lousy, cheating businessman, @realDonaldTrump. The sham is over.
Sun Jul 17 14:37:38 +0000 2016 Seriously, I could do this all day, @realDonaldTrump… https://t.co/Q6Tv3m1SdX https://t.co/Me3CULGxTI

Sun Jul 17 14:28:22 +0000 2016 You want to talk about who’s a fraud, @realDonaldTrump? How about this? https://t.co/5UB05u8L4x https://t.co/sTQrNKOoA1
Sun Jul 17 14:26:21 +0000 2016 It might blow your mind that a woman worked hard &amp; earned a good job on her own, @realDonaldTrump, but it’s not the 1800s. It happens.
Sun Jul 17 14:24:29 +0000 2016 Pres Reagan's Solicitor General was the Harvard prof who hired me, @realDonaldTrump. He says your right-wing conspiracy theories are a lie.
Sun Jul 17 14:23:08 +0000 2016 Nasty name-calling &amp; lies about my family aren’t going to shut me up, @realDonaldTrump. Is that really all you’ve got?
Sat Jul 16 14:58:16 +0000 2016 Terrifying to think of @mike_pence being a heartbeat from presidency – but the direction @GOP wants to take our country is MORE terrifying.
Sat Jul 16 14:57:21 +0000 2016 The @GOP platform even says that children not from “natural marriage” are more likely to be drug addicts. Hateful AND disgusting.
Sat Jul 16 14:56:15 +0000 2016 The @GOP platform says overturn marriage equality &amp; it supports parents putting their LGBT children through conversion therapy. Disgusting.
Sat Jul 16 14:55:09 +0000 2016 And OF COURSE @realDonaldTrump – a guy who “[doesn’t] feel good” about marriage equality – picked a VP famous for LGBT discrimination.
Sat Jul 16 14:53:18 +0000 2016 The @GOP platform is the most anti-choice ever: defund @PPFA &amp; denounce all abortion. Even cases of rape, incest &amp; woman's potential death.
Sat Jul 16 14:51:47 +0000 2016 What's worse? @realDonaldTrump &amp; @mike_pence’s sexism isn’t some radical fringe of the @GOP. They're in line with the party platform.
Sat Jul 16 14:50:32 +0000 2016 Of COURSE @realDonaldTrump – a guy who calls women fat pigs &amp; bimbos – picked a VP who is famous for trying to control women’s bodies.
Sat Jul 16 14:49:21 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump &amp; @mike_pence are a perfect match: Two small, insecure, weak men who use hate &amp; fear to divide our country &amp; our people.
Wed Jul 13 16:38:03 +0000 2016 I'm about to speak at @amprog about how to level the playing field for workers. Watch live: https://t.co/uTBS9omM4U #americasagenda
Wed Jul 13 16:37:31 +0000 2016 It’s Congress that’s out of step with the American people. The fight for #americasagenda is uphill – but if we don’t fight, we can’t win.
Wed Jul 13 16:37:00 +0000 2016 For more than a generation, deliberate gov policies that once favored workers now favor billionaires &amp; giant corporations. #americasagenda
Tue Jul 12 21:39:10 +0000 2016 Bruce &amp; I got married 36 yrs ago today. I’m sure glad I asked — &amp; sure glad he said yes. Happy anniversary, Sweetie! https://t.co/0b1qNVMEgo

Sun Jun 12 23:41:13 +0000 2016 America is strongest when we unite &amp; celebrate our diversity. When we promote those values abroad &amp; live them here at home. #loveislove

Mon May 30 14:17:02 +0000 2016 We honor those who have served our nation with courage – on Memorial Day &amp; every other day too. https://t.co/43ZVncwfja
Thu May 26 21:43:32 +0000 2016 If @realDonaldTrump means my job at Harvard, he can ask Charles Fried, Solicitor General for Reagan. He says loud &amp; clear that’s a lie.
Thu May 26 21:41:36 +0000 2016 Get your facts straight, @realDonaldTrump.  I didn’t even go to Harvard – I’m a graduate of @UHouston and @RutgersU.
Wed May 25 17:24:38 +0000 2016 Fling as much mud as you want, @realDonaldTrump. Your words &amp; actions disqualify you from being President - &amp; I won't stop saying it.
Wed May 25 17:22:59 +0000 2016 I fight for working families every day, @realDonaldTrump. You fight only for Donald Trump.
Wed May 25 17:21:47 +0000 2016 Anytime someone calls out @realDonaldTrump, he replies with right-wing conspiracies &amp; lies. It’s not presidential - &amp; getting very old.
Wed May 25 17:19:29 +0000 2016 If @realDonaldTrump actually believes every stupid lie he reads on the Internet, we’re in for a truckload of trouble if he’s President.
Wed May 25 17:18:05 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump: I helped family buy their homes and out-of-work construction worker relatives make a living. I’m proud of that.
Wed May 25 17:16:30 +0000 2016 Explain why you don’t pay taxes that our country needs to keep us safe, @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/5tpKNIjVdt
Wed May 25 17:15:03 +0000 2016 Explain why you want to let Wall Street off the hook, @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/5tpKNIjVdt
Wed May 25 17:13:47 +0000 2016 Watch this video, @realDonaldTrump. Explain why you root for working people to fail. https://t.co/5tpKNIjVdt
Wed May 25 03:45:19 +0000 2016 Tonight I called out @realDonaldTrump in not-so-subtle terms. Watch this. https://t.co/5tpKNIjVdt
Fri May 20 02:15:02 +0000 2016 .@RealDonaldTrump trolls for votes &amp; wants working ppl to believe he's for them. News flash, Donald: working ppl are smarter than you think.
Fri May 20 02:13:43 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump made clear he would abolish the federal minimum wage. One of a million reasons why working ppl can't make him the boss.
Fri May 20 02:12:20 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump got destroyed on his min wage position. I was right when I called him out. https://t.co/ZCZXNGzUnb https://t.co/l7WG2CjuHJ
Fri May 13 21:34:33 +0000 2016 I worked with @KamalaHarris -- she's tough, principled &amp; fearless. Happy to support her campaign!  https://t.co/jfloN6wyii
Thu May 12 00:49:33 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump can’t talk about Wall St, college costs or min wage, so he spent all day belching insults. Pathetic. Really pathetic.
Wed May 11 18:02:27 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump: Your policies are dangerous. Your words are reckless. Your record is embarrassing. And your free ride is over.
Wed May 11 18:00:33 +0000 2016 When asked what gov should stop doing, @realDonaldTrump said overseeing banks! How can you be tough on Wall Street by letting them off?
Wed May 11 17:59:25 +0000 2016 You're so concerned about Wall Street, @realDonaldTrump, that you say you’d “absolutely” repeal Dodd-Frank?
Wed May 11 17:57:19 +0000 2016 You feel so much for people with college debt, @realDonaldTrump, that you raked in millions scamming students with Trump University?
Wed May 11 17:55:28 +0000 2016 You care so much about struggling American workers, @realDonaldTrump, that you want to abolish the federal minimum wage?
Wed May 11 17:53:56 +0000 2016 Do you think you're going to shut us up, @realDonaldTrump? Think again. It's time to answer for your dangerous ideas.
Wed May 11 17:52:34 +0000 2016 We get it, @realDonaldTrump: When a woman stands up to you, you’re going to call her a basket case. Hormonal. Ugly.
Sat May 07 03:31:30 +0000 2016 No, @realDonaldTrump - your racism, sexism &amp; xenophobia doesn't drive me nuts. It makes me sick. And I'm not alone.
Sat May 07 00:49:10 +0000 2016 Whatever @realDonaldTrump says, we won't shut up. We won't back down. This election is too important, &amp; he won’t step foot in White House.
Sat May 07 00:46:45 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump lied his way through the primaries without being held accountable. That’s over.
Sat May 07 00:45:26 +0000 2016 The @GOP's hate-filled lies didn’t scare me before, @realDonaldTrump. And they don't scare me now.
Sat May 07 00:44:24 +0000 2016 If you think recycling Scott Brown's hate-filled attacks on my family is going to shut me up, @realDonaldTrump, think again buddy. Weak.
Sat May 07 00:43:06 +0000 2016 But here's the thing. You can beat a bully -- not by tucking tail and running, but by holding your ground.
Sat May 07 00:41:57 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump spews insults and lies because he can’t have an honest conversation about his dangerous vision for America.
Sat May 07 00:37:54 +0000 2016 .@realdonaldtrump is a bully who has a single play in his playbook -- offensive lies thrown at anyone who calls him out.
Sat May 07 00:37:31 +0000 2016 We saw when Scott Brown attacked my family &amp; his staff made tomahawk chops &amp; war whoops. They lost big. MA voters knew better.
Sat May 07 00:37:11 +0000 2016 We saw what happened when birthers like @realDonaldTrump attacked @BarackObama. They lost big. American voters knew better.
Sat May 07 00:36:48 +0000 2016 “Goofy,” @realDonaldTrump? For a guy with "the best words" that’s a pretty lame nickname. Weak!
Sat May 07 00:36:17 +0000 2016 I called out @realDonaldTrump on Tuesday. 45 million saw it. He's so confident about his "counter punch" he waited until Friday night. Lame.
Wed May 04 02:51:54 +0000 2016 I'm going to fight my heart out to make sure @realDonaldTrump’s toxic stew of hatred &amp; insecurity never reaches the White House.
Wed May 04 02:51:18 +0000 2016 It will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man's narcissism and divisiveness.
Wed May 04 02:50:41 +0000 2016 What happens next will test the character for all of us – Republican, Democrat, and Independent.
Wed May 04 02:50:07 +0000 2016 And @realDonaldTrump puts out out contradictory &amp; nonsensical national security ideas one expert called "incoherent" &amp; "truly bizarre."
Wed May 04 02:49:35 +0000 2016 @realDonaldTrump surrounds himself w/ foreign policy advisors who've been called a “collection of charlatans.”
Wed May 04 02:48:58 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump attacks vets like @SenJohnMcCain who were captured &amp; puts our servicemembers at risk by cheerleading illegal torture.
Wed May 04 02:48:19 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump incites supporters to violence, praises Putin, and is "cool with being called an authoritarian."
Wed May 04 02:47:31 +0000 2016 There's more enthusiasm for @realDonaldTrump among leaders of the KKK than leaders of the political party he now controls.
Wed May 04 02:46:58 +0000 2016 Here’s what else is real: @realDonaldTrump has built his campaign on racism, sexism, and xenophobia.
Wed May 04 02:46:32 +0000 2016 .@realDonaldTrump is now the leader of the @GOP. It's real - he is one step away from the White House.
Fri Apr 29 21:09:24 +0000 2016 We need @TammyforIL in the Senate - &amp; a Democratic majority - to fight for working families in IL &amp; across the country. #standwithTammy

Tue Apr 19 21:24:04 +0000 2016 Hey @TedCruz: Maybe you should spend less time complaining about your "significant sacrifices" - &amp; more time doing something about theirs.
Tue Apr 19 21:23:43 +0000 2016 You chose to run for President, @TedCruz. You chose to make your “sacrifices.” Working people don't have a choice.
Tue Apr 19 21:23:15 +0000 2016 They don't throw tantrums or try to shut down their workplace because they don't get their way - &amp; then turn around &amp; demand promotions.
Tue Apr 19 21:22:42 +0000 2016 And @TedCruz? Working people work more, get paid less, can't save, get mistreated, struggle with illness &amp; family - but they don't whine.
Tue Apr 19 21:22:15 +0000 2016 Know who’s facing "constant attacks," @TedCruz? Hardworking American immigrants, Muslims, LGBT folks, women. Your constant attacks.
Tue Apr 19 21:21:43 +0000 2016 Know who gets no family time, @TedCruz? Moms w/ unfair schedules who drop kids at daycare &amp; find their hrs cancelled. @GOP won't help.
Tue Apr 19 21:21:16 +0000 2016 Know who gets no personal time? People who work 2 min wage jobs to support their families. @TedCruz opposes giving them a raise.
Tue Apr 19 21:20:45 +0000 2016 Know whose sleep is limited? Working parents who stay up worrying about getting kids thru college w/o big debt. @TedCruz blocked #refi.
Tue Apr 19 21:20:21 +0000 2016 Know whose health is limited? Workers w/ no paid leave who can't stay home when sick or caring for kids. @TedCruz won't support it.
Tue Apr 19 21:19:53 +0000 2016 Are you kidding me, @TedCruz? We’re supposed to pity you because trying to be the leader of the free world is hard?! 2 words: Boo hoo.
Tue Apr 19 21:19:21 +0000 2016 .@TedCruz whined about facing constant attacks, nonexistent family time, limited health and sleep, and no personal time.
Tue Apr 19 21:18:14 +0000 2016 Yesterday @TedCruz sent a campaign email whining about the “significant sacrifice” he’s made to run for President. https://t.co/yKtLpWG0Ou
Sun Apr 10 16:05:03 +0000 2016 Does the front page of the @BostonGlobe Ideas section scare you? It should. https://t.co/Wml4jJZ0gv https://t.co/qBYbwPjSrF
Thu Apr 07 23:29:30 +0000 2016 Read my new @BostonGlobe op-ed telling @Senate_GOPs to #doyourjob. https://t.co/r0sTXpr1Aw
Thu Apr 07 23:28:48 +0000 2016 .@Senate_GOPs can start proving they can govern responsibly by doing their jobs &amp; considering @POTUS's nominee to the Supreme Court.
Thu Apr 07 23:28:20 +0000 2016 If the @Senate_GOPs don't like having to pick between Donald Trump &amp; Ted Cruz, they should stand up to extremists in their party.
Thu Mar 31 04:37:19 +0000 2016 Thanks for watching @colbertlateshow, East Coast! If we fight, we win – so join our fight: https://t.co/BNl2I14xqn #lateshow #lssc

Mon Mar 21 19:45:39 +0000 2016 We cannot elect wannabe tyrants to the White House. Not now, not ever. It’s up to all of us us to stop @realDonaldTrump .
Mon Mar 21 19:45:05 +0000 2016 .@RealDonaldTrump is “cool with being called an authoritarian,” isn't upset at Hitler comparisons &amp; thinks we won’t fight back? WRONG!
Mon Mar 21 19:44:30 +0000 2016 Why is it that @realDonaldTrump can call himself the “unity” candidate while basing his campaign on racism, sexism, xenophobia &amp; hatred?
Mon Mar 21 16:22:53 +0000 2016 The way I see it, it’s our job to make sure @realDonaldTrump ends this campaign every bit the loser that he started it.
Mon Mar 21 16:22:24 +0000 2016 Many of history’s worst authoritarians started out as losers – and @realDonaldTrump is a serious threat.
Mon Mar 21 16:22:01 +0000 2016 .@RealDonaldTrump stands ready to tear apart an America that was built on values like decency, community, and concern for our neighbors.
Mon Mar 21 16:21:30 +0000 2016 But just because @realDonaldTrump is a loser everywhere else doesn’t mean he’ll lose this election.
Mon Mar 21 16:20:57 +0000 2016 .@RealDonaldTrump knows he’s a loser. His insecurities are on parade: petty bullying, attacks on women, cheap racism, flagrant narcissism.
Mon Mar 21 16:20:32 +0000 2016 Listen to experts who say @realDonaldTrump might have more money today if he’d put his inheritance in an index fund &amp; left it alone.
Mon Mar 21 16:19:53 +0000 2016 See how @realDonaldTrump kept his father’s empire afloat using strategic corporate bankruptcies to skip out on debt.
Mon Mar 21 16:19:30 +0000 2016 Let’s be honest - @realDonaldTrump is a loser. Count all his failed businesses. See how he cheated people w/ scams like Trump U.
Sun Mar 20 15:03:33 +0000 2016 People ask me whether I regret my big decision, but it's too late: I'm here again at the #BostonStPats breakfast. https://t.co/jwYMF543fT
Mon Feb 29 05:02:45 +0000 2016 And no Best Picture award, but #TheBigShort made clear we will not forget that Wall St broke our economy. This ain't over. #Oscars

Fri Jan 08 17:15:22 +0000 2016 This is business as usual for Wall Street and Washington insiders, and it stinks.
Fri Jan 08 17:15:05 +0000 2016 Not sure what’s more disgusting: That Jeb is pinning his 2016 hopes on his bro’s bailout $, or that bailed-out CEOs want to buy elections.
Fri Jan 08 17:14:43 +0000 2016 And now, Greenberg is giving $10 million of his AIG fortune to try to save Jeb Bush’s dying Presidential campaign. https://t.co/buFLQUBaYR
Fri Jan 08 17:14:07 +0000 2016 Once his GOP friends left office, Greenberg sued the Obama Administration because – get this – the bailout wasn’t generous enough for him…
Fri Jan 08 17:13:43 +0000 2016 Hank Greenberg left his company just before AIG took a $182 billion bailout from the Bush Administration…
Fri Jan 08 17:13:25 +0000 2016 Let's get this straight: CEO Hank Greenberg ran AIG as it recklessly gambled on mortgage-backed securities...
Wed Jan 06 16:41:24 +0000 2016 I'm glad that ALL the Dem candidates for president – @HillaryClinton, @BernieSanders &amp; @MartinOMalley – are fighting for Wall St reform.
Wed Jan 06 15:10:23 +0000 2016 We need to level the playing field and end too big to fail.
Wed Jan 06 15:10:12 +0000 2016 I'm glad @BernieSanders is out there fighting to hold big banks accountable, make our economy safer, &amp; stop the GOP from rigging the system.
Wed Jan 06 15:09:53 +0000 2016 But the 2016 Republicans claim they'll repeal all the new financial regulations – hoping to be chosen as Wall Street's favorite candidate.
Wed Jan 06 15:09:22 +0000 2016 11 big banks are still so risky that if any one started to fail, they'd need a gov bailout or risk taking down the economy – again.
Wed Jan 06 00:05:13 +0000 2016 Took our granddaughter to the Boston @museumofscience today to catch their Pixar exhibit. Amazing – and fun! https://t.co/qnHTuY6VGY

Mon Dec 07 14:59:41 +0000 2015 I agree with @HillaryClinton: “President Obama &amp; congressional Democrats should do everything they can to stop these efforts.”
Mon Dec 07 14:58:00 +0000 2015 .@HillaryClinton is right to fight GOP efforts to sneak financial reform rollbacks into the funding bill. https://t.co/SyxC6L8tA0
Wed Nov 11 03:39:57 +0000 2015 So here's my message to Wall Street &amp; their GOP buddies: we're ready to fight back to protect the @CFPB. #GOPDebate
Wed Nov 11 03:39:38 +0000 2015 Wall Street knows if they soften @CFPB support, the GOP will feel better undercutting the agency in closed-door deals. #GOPDebate
Wed Nov 11 03:39:15 +0000 2015 Thousands of dollars on a TV ad is nothing compared to the money the big banks save if their GOP buddies go after the @CFPB. #GOPDebate
Wed Nov 11 03:38:52 +0000 2015 The @CFPB has forced the big financial companies to return more than $11B to people they cheated on credit cards, mortgages, etc. #GOPDebate
Wed Nov 11 03:38:31 +0000 2015 Wall Street has a problem: They know the @CFPB is working, &amp; it's incredibly popular with the families it helps. #GOPDebate
Wed Nov 11 03:38:08 +0000 2015 So... Can we talk about that ad that just ran during the #GOPDebate where I look like a Commie dictator?
