Tue Jun 14 16:49:32 +0000 2016 This is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for those who look or love or worship one way‚Äîfor all.
Tue Jun 14 16:45:38 +0000 2016 We need to work together to keep our country and our citizens safe.  None of this will be helped by anything Trump has to offer.
Tue Jun 14 16:43:47 +0000 2016 People can‚Äôt board planes with full shampoo bottles‚Äîbut people being watched by the FBI for terrorism can buy a gun, no questions asked?
Tue Jun 14 16:42:21 +0000 2016 We need a Commander-in-Chief who can grapple with our challenges in all their complexity, with real plans that actually address them.
Tue Jun 14 16:40:58 +0000 2016 Trump's statements are lies‚Äîbut he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.

Mon Jun 13 17:34:01 +0000 2016 The terrorist in Orlando targeted LGBT Americans out of hatred and bigotry.   An attack on any American is an attack on all Americans.
Mon Jun 13 17:32:39 +0000 2016 Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror. It‚Äôs wrong, and it's dangerous.

Mon Jun 13 17:28:43 +0000 2016 In Orlando and San Bernardino, terrorists used assault weapons like the AR-15 to kill Americans. We should make it harder for them to do so.
Mon Jun 13 17:26:59 +0000 2016 If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.

Wed Mar 30 22:49:13 +0000 2016 Women, especially low-income women and women of color, are already being punished by GOP-led efforts to stigmatize and restrict health care.
